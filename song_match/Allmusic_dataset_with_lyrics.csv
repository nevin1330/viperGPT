You're too lovely to last

Will I ever know of real love
So I can forget you?

What am I to do?

Soon the night is gone
Dreams are fading fast

He must have had a life, maybe with a family
People who meant everything to him
A sinner, a saint, a soldier caught up in a war
He never had a chance to start or build a life

Leaving no trace, disappearing like smoke in the wind
To become just a face without a name
Leaving no trace, disappearing like smoke in the wind

Hopes and fears important plans, forgotten memories
Footsteps fading in the sand, oh
Schemes and dreams small and grand, nothing left to see
Footsteps fading in the sand, oh

Someone who cast a shadow, maybe just a lazy man
Doesn't make much difference now it's true
A day of uncertain weather, captured in a frame forever

Leaving no trace, disappearing like smoke in the wind
To become just a face without a name
One more to add to the total of those never heard of again

Folks will welcome home their rolling stones
For every navy mans a king

The writing on the wall
A Lazarus in parable

A dark and sullen lullaby
Whispered softly as you die
Promising torments are nigh

Danger warning levels hissed out loud
I saw the silver lining hidden in a mushroom cloud
Now I'm reeling from the shock at ground zero

If yesterday you would have stood up proud
Then why tonight have you thrown in with the stoning crowd?
I'll breathe through the foetus of a new day kicking

The foetus of a new day kicking

It's true that Jesus cannot save
I'm rising from the grave
To put my double cross to shame

A poison rush, a heart attack
A white assassin painted black
You'll fear this reaper coming back

Danger warning levels hissed out loud
I saw the silver lining hidden in a mushroom cloud
Now I'm reeling from the shock at ground zero

If yesterday you would have stood up proud
Then why tonight have you thrown in with the stoning crowd?
I'll breathe through the foetus of a new day kicking

On a night like this
You laid the serpent's kiss
In this garden of Gethsemane
You played the traitor well

In a dawn to come
I will blind the sun
To grant you pardon as my enemy

Before damning you to hell

Danger warning levels hissed out loud

Sometimes in my sleep I hold you close against my skin
Waking up I wish that I could sleep and dream again
Cause only in my dreams can I know how it might have been
But cheaters never win, their heartaches never end

But sometimes I get crazy as lovers often do
Trying to please him and wondering if she's pleasing you
Though they have every right to any part of us they choose
I still live just for you and our secret rendezvous

[Chorus]
Torn between two lovers on the jukebox
I'm thinking how I could have wrote that song
Wondering if God loves us when we're cheating
Oh, but why he lets us feel things if it's wrong
And I guess I should be signing ""Rock of Ages""
""Amazing Grace"" and some of those good songs
But my cheating heart will tell on me tomorrow
If you think that God won't get you, well you're wrong

[Verse 3]
Thou shalt not commit it, it's written in the ""Ten""
The spirit's always willing, but the flesh is weak again
And you're as close to heaven as I might ever fly
An angel in disguise
A wrong that feels so right

Torn between two lovers just keeps playing
I don't want to be right if loving you is wrong
I'm wondering if God loves us when we're cheating
Oh, but why we have to feel things if it's so wrong?

It's good to touch the green, green grass of home

Four gray walls surround me
And I realize I was only dreaming
There's a guard and there's a sad old padre
Arm and arm we'll walk at daybreak

Yes, they'll all come to see me
In the shade of that old oak tree
As they lay me neath the green, green grass of home"

Big Sur, my astrology

Fog rolls in through a redwood grove

Feeling so afraid tonight
'Cos you're the only one that really knows

Dogs in heat, rabid, foaming
A beast caged in the heart of a city
The body of his mother
Rotting in the summer ground
He fled the town
He went down South and crossed the border
Left the chaos and disorder
Back there over his shoulder
One morning he awoke in a green hotel
With a strange creature groaning beside him
Sweat oozed from its shining skin
Is everybody in? Is everybody in?
Is everybody in?
The ceremony is about to begin
Wake up!
You can't remember where it was
Had this dream stopped?
The snake was pale gold, glazed and shrunken
We were afraid to touch it
The sheets were hot dead prisms
And she was beside me
Old, she's no, young
Her dark red hair, the white soft skin
Now, run to the mirror in the bathroom
Look! she's coming in here
I can't live through each slow century of her moving
I let my cheek slide down, the cool smooth tile
Feel the good cold stinging blood
The smooth hissing snakes of rain
Once I had a little game
I liked to crawl back in my brain
I think you know, the game I mean
I mean the game, called, 'Go insane'
You should try this little game
Just close your eyes forget your name
Forget the world, forget the people
And we'll erect, a different steeple
This little game is fun to do
Just close your eyes, no way to lose
And I'm right there, I'm going too
Release control, we're breaking through
Way back deep into the brain
Back where there's never any pain
And the rain falls gently on the town
And over the heads of all of us
And in the labyrinth of streams
Beneath, the quiet unearthly presence of
Gentle hill dwellers, in the gentle hills around
Reptiles abounding
Fossils, caves, cool air heights
Each house repeats a mold, windows rolled
Beast car locked in against morning
All now sleeping
Rugs silent, mirrors vacant
Dust Lying under the beds of lawful couples
Wound in sheets
And daughters, smug
With semen eyes in their nipples
Wait
There's been a slaughter here
Don't stop to speak or look around
Your gloves and fan are on the ground
We're getting out of town, we're going on the run
And you're the one I want to come
Not to touch the earth
Not to see the sun
Nothing left to do, but
Run, run, run
Let's run, let's run
House upon the hill, moon is lying still
Shadows of the trees
Witnessing the wild breeze
C'mon baby run with me
Let's run
Run with me
Run with me
Run with me
Let's run
The mansion is warm at the top of the hill
Rich are the rooms and the comforts there
Red are the arms of luxuriant chairs
And you won't know a thing till you get inside
Dead President's corpse in the driver's car
The engine runs on glue and tar
C'mon along, we're not going very far
To the East to meet the Czar
Run with me
Run with me
Run with me
Let's run
Some outlaws lived by the side of the lake
The minister's daughter's in love with the snake
Who lives in a well by the side of the road
Wake up, girl! We're almost home
We should see the gates by mornin'
We should be inside by evening
Sun, sun, sun
Burn, burn, burn
Burn, burn, burn
I will get you
Soon, soon, soon
I am the lizard king
I can do anything
We came down
The rivers and highways
We came down from
Forests and falls
We came down from
Carson and Springfield
We came down from
Phoenix enthralled
And I can tell you
The names of the Kingdom
I can tell you
The things that you know
Listening for a fistful of silence
Climbing valleys into the shade
For seven years, I dwelt
In the loose palace of exile
Playing strange games with the girls of the island
Now, I have come again
To the land of the fair and the strong and the wise
Brothers and sisters of the pale forest
Children of night
Who among you will run with the hunt?
Now night arrives with her purple legion
Retire now to your tents and to your dreams
Tomorrow we enter the town of my birth
I want to be ready"

Was gonna keep you free and clean
And now you wear your skin like iron
And your breath as hard as kerosene
You weren't your momma's only boy
But her favorite one, it seems
She began to cry when you said goodbye
And sank into your dreams

Pancho was a bandit boy
His horse was fast as polished steel
He wore his gun outside his pants

On the deserts down in Mexico
Nobody heard his dying words
But that's the way it goes

All night long like he used to

Ended up in Lefty's mouth

Where he got the bread to go
There ain't nobody knows

They could've had him any day
We only let him slip away

And Lefty's living in cheap hotels
The desert's quiet, Cleveland's cold

But save a few for Lefty too
He only did what he had to do
And now he's growing old

A twelve acre farm on a ridge in south Tennessee
We left our sweat all over that land
Behind a mule we watched grow old
Row after row
Trying to grow corn an' cotton on ground so poor that grass won't grow
There was one old store in the holler we all called town
It belonged to a gentle old man named Henry Brown
He gave us grits and in the winter time
So we could live through the cold
When the winds brought snow
Trying to grow corn an' cotton on ground so poor that grass won't grow
The one I loved walked through those fields with me
A hard workin' woman, true as one could be
But then one year, death was goin' round
And swiftly took it's toll
Janie had to go
Now she lies asleep under ground so poor that grass won't grow
As I stand here looking over this part of Tennessee
The fields are bare as far as the eye can see
And over the ground where Janie lies
There's a beautiful sight to behold
And no one knows
Why there's flowers growin' on ground so poor that grass won't grow..."

And he wrote about it the way it was
In his travelings with Charley
And have you ever walked down through the sycamores
Where the farmhouse used to be?
There, the monarch's autumn journey ends
On a windswept cypress tree

[Chorus]
Water (Get), water
(Get yourself in that, get yourself in that)
Get yourself in that cool, clear water
(Get yourself in that water)
The sun shines brightly down on Penny's place
(Get yourself in that water)
The air's so clean that it just takes your mind away
(It takes your mind away, it takes your mind away)

[Verse 3]
Have you ever been to a festival
The Big Sur congregation?
Where Country Joe will do his show
And he'll sing about liberty
And the people there in the open air
Are one big family
Yeah, the people there love to sing and share
Their newfound liberty"

A love-struck Romeo
Sings the streets a serenade
Now he's layin' everybody low
He's got a love song that he made
He finds a convenient street light
And he steps out of the shade, and he says something like
""You and me babe, how about it?""

[Verse 2]
Juliet says, ""Hey it's Romeo
He nearly gave me a heart attack"" yeah well
He's underneath my window, now she's singing
""Hey-la my boyfriend's back""
Oh, you shouldn't come around here
Singing up to people like that
Oh anyway, whatcha gonna do about it?

[Chorus]
Juliet, the dice were loaded from the start
And I bet, and you exploded into my heart
And I forget, I forget, the movie song
When you gonna realize
It was just that the time was wrong
Julie

[Verse 3]
Well we both come up on different streets
And they were both streets of shame
You know, they're both dirty, both mean
Yes and even the dreams were the same
But I dreamed your dream for you, and
And now your dream is real, so tell me honey
Now how can you look at me as if I was just another one of your deals?

[Verse 4]
Now you can fall for chains of silver
And you can fall for chains of gold
You know ya, you fall for pretty strangers
And the promises they hold
Well you promised me everything, and then ya
And then ya promised me thick and thin
And now you just turn away
And say Romeo? I think I used to have a scene with him

[Chorus]
Ah Juliet, when we made love you used to cry
You said I love you like the stars above
Gonna love ya 'til I die
There's a place for us
I know you know this song
Now when you gonna realize
It was just that the time was wrong?
Julie, I'm so in love
So in love, yeah

[Verse 5]
But I can't do the talk
Like they talk on my TV screen
And I, I can't do a love song
Not the way you sung them to me
I can't do anything but I would
Do anything for you, oh no
I can't do anything except
Be in love with you, yeah

[Verse 6]
Now all I do is miss you
And the way it used to be, you know
And all I do is keep the beat
I keep bad, bad company
And all I do is kiss you
Through the bars of this rhyme
When Julie, I'd do the stars with you, anytime

[Chorus]
Ah Juliet, when we made love you used to cry
You said I love you like the stars above
I'm gonna love ya 'til I die
There's a place for us
I know you know the movie song
One day we're gonna realize
It was just that the time was wrong

The kind to help me clear my throat?

Then he said
What would you give to hear a song?
What price do memories bring?
It ain't every day you get to hear a living legend sing

A few words now and then
It takes a drink to make me think
And live it all again

And neither do these lines

Though it seemed so long

As the poor ship laboured on through the endless blue

But they stumbled on
Raising broken sails
And they held the heavy sky on their open hands
And they dreamed of when their poor feet would touch the land

Where is this place we're going to?
Does anybody know we're out here on the waves?
And are any of our signals coming through?
We're going 'round in circles

And like the clouds that turn to every passing wind
We turn to any signal that comes through

Uhh, uhh, where am I going
Where am I? Where the hell am I?
Yo, it's ill

[Verse 1]
Yo, my wife's tired of fucking me
Life tries ducking me
Luckily, I find 'em just at the right time
MAC in my right arm
Tequila bottle in my left arm
Like Christión –
Watching my life go
Can't do myself in
Wolves in the night, yo, Hell's men
Two revolvers, I can let twelve spin
Hop in my Benz, push it to the limit
Buck-sixty, who wit' me?
My Cris', two L's, twisted blunts, and inner conscience
Telling me that I ain't shit
No matter how much cash I sit with
Still gotta ask the Lord for forgiveness
My precious baby girl came like forty nights of rain
To replenish my adolescent brain
Blessed be her name, before her birth, I was insane
So I drive to cool the pressure down, delay the pain
I ate from these poisonous, fucked up streets
Tasted larceny, it was sweet, I starved for more to eat
Though I took, that was to live, hope God will forgive
As odd as it is, the more I gain, the harder it is
To maintain, bitches playin' games
Niggas snitchin', I ain't saying names
But y'all niggas better watch how y'all slang
Lost so many close niggas
Drunk, almost crashed
I'm going too fast
Highway patrol will just flash
Lights in my rearview
If they stop me, I hope they lock me
Instead, they speed ahead
Yo, nigga, watch me

[Chorus]
I'm drunk by myself, gun under my seat
I don't want none of my peeps caught up in none of my beef
I'ma ride to the end of the road if I have to
Praying no car speeds by for me to crash to
Steering wheel in my hand
Trying to hold it steady
Anything in my way is dead
'Cause that's the way I feel, I am already
When I'm drunk by myself, alone in the zone
Drunk by myself

[Verse 2]
Heard niggas hate me, but I hated too once
Been in the shoes of a wolf in the night when he hunts
For every shell niggas bust, we bust at ourselves
Can't tell these niggas nothing though
Bullets wake 'em up well
Take them to hell
Stick-up niggas once ran up on me
My decadent lifestyle attracted sharks on me
I ain't your mark, homie
It's hard to look straight
My foot on the brake
Spilling my bottle, not even shook of the Jakes
Could hardly look both ways
Put out the haze, blurry vision
Think about the time in my life before I was on television
Hella women
Jealous niggas up in my vision
Since we all hood niggas, expect kilos
For what they not seeing is police expect RICO
Only if I could take care of everybody, intoxicated
Windows up, blasting A/C, going wherever instinct takes me
I hate it when I'm like this
The bottle's my accomplice

[Chorus]
I'm drunk by myself, gun under my seat
I don't want none of my peeps caught up in none of my beef
I'ma ride to the end of the road if I have to
Praying no car speeds by for me to crash to
Steering wheel in my hand
I try to hold it steady
Anything in my way is dead
'Cause that's the way I feel, I am already
When I'm drunk by myself, alone in the zone
Drunk by myself

[Verse 3]
The reason that I want to be alone
Tired of all the things that went wrong
That would have went right if I would have did it on my own
Take another swig
The more I drink, the more I think bad thoughts
Fake friends who hung around, who wanna bring you down
Not knowing who to trust, rumors about niggas coming through
Supposedly to shoot at us, not knowing what was true
Or what to believe, that's why I'm on the low lately
Choosing a Henny bottle over a friend, driving again
To keep my mind off that weak shit
There's love through it all
Things to live for
I swerve, almost crash into a wall
Think about the good
Find myself laughing
Turn the cell off, no way to be reached
Know I'm near my crib
Tryna see my way through the streets
Reminded of the positive, I take my drunk ass home
Start feeling out of it, can't wait to get out of this whip
Bring my ass to the crib
I'm tired...

[Chorus]
When I'm drunk by myself, gun under the seat
I don't want none of my peeps caught up in none of my beef

Hey, come to Los Angeles!
Where you and your family can have peace and tranquility
Enjoy the refinement..
Hey Bone, hey nigga where you at though?
Hello, my name is Elaine
And I'll be your tour guide through South Central Los Angeles

[Verse 1: Ice Cube]
How to survive in South Central (What you do?)
A place where bustin' a cap is fundamental
No, you can't find the shit in a handbook
Take a close look, at a rap crook
Rule number one: get yourself a gun
A 9 and your ass'll be fine
Keep it in your glove compartment
'Cause jackers (Yo), they love to start shit
Now if you're white you can trust the police
But if you're Black, they ain't nothin but beasts
Watch out for the kill
Don't make a false move and keep your hands on the steering wheel
And don't get smart
Answer all questions, and that's your first lesson
On stayin' alive
In South Central, yeah, that's how you survive

[Break]
Hi, this is Elaine again
Are you enjoying your stay in South Central Los Angeles?
Or has somebody taken your things?
Have you witnessed a drive-by?
Okay, make sure you have your camcorder ready
To witness the extracurricular activities on blacks by the police
So you and your family can enjoy this tape, over and over again
This is Los Angeles, this is Los Angeles

[Verse 2: Ice Cube]
Rule number two: don't trust nobody
Especially a bitch with a hooker's body
'Cause it ain't nothin' but a trap
And females'll get you jacked and kidnapped
You'll wind up dead
Just to be safe don't wear no blue or red
'Cause most niggas get got
In either L.A., Compton or Watts
Pissed off Black human beings
So I think you better skip the sightseeing
And if you're nothin' but a mark
Make sure that you're in before dark
But if you need some affection, mate
Make sure the bitch ain't a Section 8
'Cause if so that's a monkey-wrench ho
And you won't survive in South Central

[Break]
Now you realize it's not all that it's cracked up to be
You realize that it's fucked up!
It ain't nothin' like the shit you saw on TV
Palm trees and blonde bitches?
I'd advise to you to pack your shit and get the fuck on, punk motherfucker!
And you'll get your ass straight smoked
Yo, I wanna say what's up to DJ Chilly Chill, Sir Jinx
Ayo Cube, these motherfuckers don't know what time it is
So show these motherfuckers what's happenin'
Tell these motherfuckers, don't fuck around in South Central
Goddammit!

[Verse 3: Ice Cube]
Rule number three: don't get caught up
'Cause niggas are doing anything that's thought up
And they got a price
On everything from dope to stolen merchandise
Weed to sherm
'Cause South Central L.A. is one big germ
Waitin' for a brother like you to catch a disease
And start slangin' ki's
To an undercover or the wrong brother
And they'll smother, a out of town motherfucker
So don't take your life for granted
'Cause it's the craziest place on the planet
In L.A., heroes don't fly through the sky of stars
They live behind bars
So everybody's doin' a little dirt
And it's the youngsters puttin' in the most work
So be alert and stay calm
As you enter the concrete Vietnam
You say the strong survive
Shit, the strong even die in South Central

[Outro]
Yeah, you bitches, you think I forgot about your ass you tramp-ass hoes?
You better watch out
And for you so called baller-ass niggas, you know what time it is
South Central ain't no joke
Got to keep your gat at all times motherfuckers
Better keep one in the chamber and nine in the clip goddammit
You'll sho' get got, just like that
This ain't no joke, motherfuckers
Now I wanna send a shoutout to E-Dog, the engineer
Puttin' his two cents in

This is Los Angeles"

My body starts to rise
In my mind, the horror lives
To feel death deep inside
Relentless lust of rotting flesh
To thrash the tomb she lies
Heathen whore of Satan's wrath
I spit at your demise

[Bridge 1]
Virgin child, now drained of life
Your soul cannot be free
Not given the chance to rot in Hell

[Verse 2]
Satan's cross points to Hell
The Earth, I must uncover
A passion grows to feast upon
The frozen blood inside her
I feel the urge, the growing need
To fuck the sinful corpse
My task complete, the bitch's soul
Lies raped in demonic lust

[Lead: King]

[Verse 3]
Her stomach bursts, the casket breaks
The seed has taken form
A writhing shape of twisted flesh
The Devil's child is thrown
Hungry for the smell of death
He rules forbidden evil
Vengeance with a frenzied hatred
The bastard now must die

[Bridge]
Lost souls of the dead
Form legions that burst through Hell's gates
Death of one sacrifice
To avenge the raped corpse from the grave
Blood of one mortal man
The fire grows stronger within
Fate of a frenzied lust
Lucifer takes my dark soul

[Outro]
Down to the fiery pits of Hell
Down to the fiery pits of
Hell

Thinking of the pain

Afraid to ask forgiveness

To learn to cast it aside
And come to you with honesty

And say I'll see you around

You still have a choice
And I hope and pray you'll make it

And you won't wanna break it
And I'll prove to you
The kind of lady I can be

We had it once, we ain't got it anymore""

And I feel like I'm a rider
On a downbound train

Last night, I heard your voice
You were crying, crying, you were so alone
You said your love had never died
You were waiting for me at home
Put on my jacket, I ran through the woods
I ran till I thought my chest would explode
There in a clearing beyond the highway
In the moonlight, our wedding house shone
I rushed through the yard, I burst through the front door
My head pounding hard, up the stairs I climbed
The room was dark, our bed was empty
Then I heard that long whistle whine
And I dropped to my knees, hung my head, and cried
Now I swing a sledgehammer on a railroad gang
Knocking down them cross ties, working in the rain

And together they're trying to tell us a story
That should have been listened to long, long ago

How the life in the mountains is living in danger
From too many people, too many machines
And the time is upon us, today is forever
Tomorrow is just one of yesterday's dreams

Cold nights in Canada and icy blue winds
The man and the mountains are brothers again
Clear waters are laughing, they sing to the skies
The Rockies are living, they never will die

I've been wrong
I've been of no use
I wander these streets alone
Heard every excuse
I go to pieces
Why don't you
Get carried away
I go to pieces
Why don't you

I've know all about
The pain I've caused you
I wish I could run away
What else can I do
Cause I go to pieces
Why don't you
Stick in my side
I go to pieces
Why don't you
Hear anything that I say
Watching you drifting away

I've known all about
Love I've refused
I tried to hide you away
Ain't no use
I go to pieces
Why don't you
Know what it means
I go to pieces
Why don't you
Get carried away
I go to pieces
Why don't you
Why don't you

As headlights on the interstate
I pulled the covers over my head
And tried to catch some sleep

Ever since you found yourself in someone else's arms
I've been trying my best to get along
But that's OK
There's nothing left to say, but

Take your records, take your freedom
Take your memories, I don't need them
Take your space and take your reasons

And take your cat and leave my sweater

In fact I'll feel a whole lot better
But you'll think of me, you'll think of me

I went out driving trying to clear my head
I tried to sweep out all the ruins that my emotions left
I guess I'm feeling just a little tired of this
And all the baggage that seems to still exist
It seems the only blessing I have left to my name
Is not knowing what we could have been
What we should have been
So

Take your records, take your freedom
Take your memories, I don't need them
Take your space and take your reasons

And take your cat and leave my sweater

So take your records, take your freedom
Take your memories, I don't need them
And take your cat and leave my sweater
Cause we have nothing left to weather
In fact I'll feel a whole lot better
But you'll think of me
Take your records, take your freedom
Take your memories, I don't need them
Take your space and all your reasons

Sometimes we sing, sometimes we play, sometimes we scat
But most of all it's how you feel about the groove
And when it's groovin', how the groove makes you move

Jazz music sprouted rock and roll
It was the very first music that we call soul
Jazz is hot, it's cool, it's good, it's bad
And it can change your mood to happy from sad

Jazz is hip, it's groovy, it's fresh, it's jive
And when you play it, it makes your soul come alive
You know it's the upbeat rhythm that makes it bop
And once you get it started, well, it sure is hard to stop

No other music can compare
When the bass starts walkin', it fills the air
You know that the sass of brass has made it last
And it's the groove of blues from present to past

Hey, what about some of those great legends of jazz?
Yeah, like Jazz Royalty
Oh, you mean Duke Ellington and Count Bassie
What about the great horn players?
Louis Armstrong, yeah, and Miles and Dizzy too
Don't forget Snookie
What about Yarnburn?
What, don't you mean Charlie Parker?
Yeah, this cool named Freddy Hubert

Someone to love

Someone to draw the sword

Took a shortcut through the woods and I lost my way

But then a kind old man took my hand, and led me home

And I knew in my heart he was the answer to my prayers

Sent down to us from somewhere up above
They come to you and me in our darkest hours
To show us how to live to teach us how to give
To guide us with the light of love

When life held troubled times and had me down on my knees
There's always been someone to come along and comfort me
A kind word from a stranger to lend a helping hand
A phone call from a friend just to say I understand
But ain't it kind of funny at the dark end of the road
That someone lights the way with just a single ray of hope

Oh, I believe there are angels among us
Sent down to us from somewhere up above
They come to you and me in our darkest hours

To grace us with their mercy in our time of need

Can you picture my prophecy?
Stress in the city, the cops is hot for me
The projects is full of bullets
Though bodies is droppin' there ain't no stoppin' me
Constantly movin' while makin' millions
Witnessin' killings, leavin' dead bodies in abandoned buildings
Can't reach the children, 'cause they're illin'
Addicted to killin' and the appeal from the cap peelin'
Without feelin', but will they last or be blasted?
Hard-headed bastard, maybe he'll listen in his casket
The aftermath: more bodies bein' buried
I'm losin' my homies in a hurry, they're relocatin' to the cemetery
Got me worried, stressin', my vision's blurry
The question is will I live, no one in the world loves me
I'm headed for danger, don't trust strangers
Put one in the chamber whenever I'm feelin' this anger
Don't wanna make excuses

The message I stress: to make it stop, study your lessons
Don't settle for less, even the genius asks his questions
Be grateful for blessings
Don't ever change, keep your essence
The power is in the people and politics we address
Always do your best, don't let this pressure make you panic
And when you get stranded
And things don't go the way you planned it
Dreamin' of riches, in a position of makin' a difference

Tennis shoes up on the handle bars

Look heart, no hands

It took a little time to get up to speed
To find the confidence and strength I'd need
To just let go and reach for the sky
You know sometimes it felt I could fly

From depression, drugs and increasing poverty
The key is to the lock, the lock is on the door
The door has a knob that you've never turned before
The jack, use the jack, it opens up the lock
Cuz there's the key to unlock the body
Place it like that to open up the door
The door to the house full of people galore
The beat won't stop 'til the JM jocks
And he jacks the box 'til the party rocks
The clock tick-tocks and the place gets hot
And believe it or not, all the troubles you forgot
It's just that easy if you want it to be
For all the fellas, and the young ladies
So ease your mind and set yourself free
To the mystifying music that we call Cindy C

But it was She who has infected me for all eternity

As the sun slips the tearaway stars
Into the scented scheme of night
I kissed her mouth like a dark red rose
Set upon a marbled dream of white
So pure of thought like a Vestal statue
Jewelled with a God-lent grace
I was close to coming when she bid adieu
Fuelled by heartache rent upon her face there

Oh Mina, obscener
Thoughts obsess my days
Oh Mina, obscener
Thoughts possess me
That I must now obey

They say the darkest hour is that before the dawn
When nothing in one's power can dissipate the great forlorn
Shadows of fire that haunt me
Like risen whispers of her name
For dawn is a dusk wherein needs must
Erupt from the grave, aflame

Written in the dead of night, dead of night
And riding on the burning wind
Smitten by her read delight, read delight
My words alight like leaves of sin

Stepping through a mirror
The princess of the emerald glass
Brought me one step nearer
Love's infernal past

They say Hell hath no furies like a woman scorned by life
When the Heavenly Judge and juries participate to chain this wife
With forced virtue Her secret needs drew on my foreign blood
On warm we nights with storm-wracked bites I gave her Eden after the flood

Written in the dead of night, dead of night
And riding on the burning wind
Smitten by her read delight, read delight
My words alight like leaves of sin

Verona, Marishka, Aleera
Brides of old and goddesses all
Forgive my wishes to be always near her
Forever or whenever seas recall

The Aphrodite from my embrace
For as Mars whom her lips placate
I tore these shores with wars of hatred
Before our Paris set his fate
In Helen, one might find mistake
In winning tragedy for all eternity

I am still lovesick for Mina
I am still so lovesick for her
I am still lovesick for Mina
I am still so lovesick for her"

She made a bet with her sister, who's a little bit dumb
She could prove it any time all men was scum

And some bovine perspiration on her upper lip area

I told her:
""Just because the sun want a place in the sky
No reason to assume I wouldn't give her a try""

Got her legs in the air
An' asked her if she had any cooties on there
""Whaddya mean, cooties!? No cooties on me!""

She was buns-up kneelin'

I was wheelin' an dealin'
(Wheelin' an' dealin' an' ooooh!)
She surrender to the feelin'
(Sweetly surrendered)
An' she started in to squealin'

Dinah-Moe watched from the edge of the bed
With her lips just twitchin' an' her face gone red
Some drool rollin' down from the edge of her chin
While she spied the condition her sister was in
She quivered 'n quaked an' clutched at herself
While her sister made a joke about her mental health
Until Dinah-Moe finally did give in
But I told her all she really needed was some discipline

That's when I said
Kiss my aura... Dora...

One word conversations do not work somehow
Tell me, how does one get your soul in touch with the one above
When one way conversations pay a price for the use of love?

I live with the fear of the few with the gift
And I know what's going to be

Why did you never speak my name in front of my family?
You gave a gift that you then took away like you never did before
Your name might be God, but you don't say that much to me
Your name might be God, but you don't say that much to me
We might be your black sheep, but you forgot us a long time ago
We might be your lost sheep, but it's time you remembered us now

As we spend our days together, nothing can go wrong
No one told the truth about it because it was so strong

Whatever I have done for you I did because you complained

Giving it all from within

Safe in the trees you had tears on your face
Wrestling with your desires frozen strangers
Stealing your fires. The message hit my mind

We're balanced together ocean upon the sky

Another night in this strange town
Moonlight holding me light as down
Voice of confusion inside of me
Just begging to go back where I'm free
Feels like I'm through
Then the old man's words are true

Far across Tomorrow Mountain
There's a life that's fancy and free
On a platinum street we'll plant our feet
It's a land that's fair to see
Won't you hurry there with me?

[Verse 4]
Just across Tomorrow Mountain
Every girl is queen of the May
And the kitchens I'm told are lined with gold
And there ain't no bills to pay

[Verse 5]
Can't you cross that distant mountain
Where it rains Chanel Number Five?
And the gutters I think are paved with mink
And the diamond bushes thrive

[Bridge]
Pigs trot around already roasted
Won't you have a slice of ham?
Marshmallows bloom already toasted
And the clouds are made of marmalade and jam

[Verse 6]
Can't you see Tomorrow Mountain?
Can't you watch it glimmer and glow?
It's a wonderful town that's upside down
And it's full of easy dough
Won't you pack your bags and go?"

Once again, I find myself with my friends
Dancin' the night away, it's like the party never ends
Then again we don't want it to stop
'Cause tonight's the night
It goes sweatbox, laser beams, flashin' lights
Wild cards, men from Mars, dressed in stars and stripes
(Eclectic electric, ladies of the evenin', drinkin' booze and minglin')
Mashin' to the music, I can do anything
Freaky dicky star speckles and pink butterflies
And life is nice, so nice
I walk into a club and I've found paradise
I'm seein' stars, I can't believe my eyes (I'm seein' stars)

Now the record always spins on the trails we blaze
The walls are closin' in, but that's okay
'Cause I've been waitin' all week to feel this way
And it feels so good, so good, I'm on top of the world
The coolest kid in the neighborhood

So let me be your star for one night that's right
Sweatbox, laser beams, flashin' lights
You've got to feel the rush, feel the spice of life

Icein', mesmerizin' the minds are sick ones
'Cause what we are, is victims of fun
Come on, come on, the fun is just begun
Come on the fun is just begun

This is a journey into sound

I was told to love you
I was told to try
I was born to save you
I was born to die
I'll always be your scapegoat
You'll never take the blame
You never had a chance
It was your soul to save
I am your one-night nightmare
Pain is all you see
The blood is on your hands
I hope you're proud of me

I was told to love you
I learned how to hate
I was born to save you
Your choice became your fate
You can't take care of yourself
How could you care for me?
I am your retribution
When is my soul free?
I never asked for mercy
You told me to forgive
The blood is on your hands
I hope you're proud of me
And what I've done to set you free
I can barely hold myself

Fascination, stimulation
Stronger as I learn
By his hand, I understand
I was told to burn

Bastard son, your saving grace
Left alone I found my place
I find love in what I steal
You should have let me rest
In Potter's field
I was told to, I was told to

Your beliefs turned me into this
Bite the hand that feeds
You're so selfish
Thank you, mother
For giving me this life
I'll bring down the rapture
Then we'll see who lies

Stronger as I learn
By his hand, I understand

He walks below the land
Alluring victims to their death
Perish to the sand
Master of the blackened arts
Living his decree
Thrives amongst the seven gates
Searching for the keys

Sorcery beyond the witches' spell
Robbed the crypts of death's eternity
Killed the priest and cursed him endlessly

Fill the murky night
Free the Devil's knights of Hell
Unleash their growing spite
Directing power forcibly
The fire of Hell is cast
Resurrect from crypts of death
A demon from the past

That I'd be playing solitaire
Uneasy in my easy chair
It never entered my mind

And once you told me I was mistaken
That I'd awaken with the sun
And ordered orange juice for one
It never entered my mind

You have what I lack, myself
Now I even have to scratch my back myself

The needle, I'll thread it, radically poetic
Standin' with the fury that they had in '66
And like E-Double ""I'm Mad"", still knee deep in the system's shit
Hoover, he was a body remover
I'll give you a dose but it can never come close
To the rage built up inside of me
Fist in the air in the land of hypocrisy
Movements come and movements go
Leaders speak, movements cease when their heads are flown
'Cause all these punks got bullets in their heads
Departments of police, (What!) the judges (What!), the feds

You know they went after King when he spoke out on Vietnam
He turned the power to the have-nots
And then came the shot

To shake you up, to break the structure up?
'Cause blood still flows in the gutter
I'm like taking photos, mad boy kicks open the shutter
Set the groove, then stick and move like I was Cassius
Rep the ""Stutter Step"" then bomb a left upon the fascists
Yeah, several federal men
Who pulled schemes on the dream and put it to an end
You better beware the retribution with mind war
20/20 visions and murals with metaphors
Networks at work, keepin' people calm
Ya know they murdered X and tried to blame it on Islam
He turned the power to the have-nots

But should he abandon his supposed 'obedience'

Just to break my heart, break my heart, oh?
Tear it all apart, all apart and
Then you let it stop, let it stop

I can't stand it, baby, you, you move me so
And my love gets started, it goes and goes and goes and
This is not a dream and what love ought to make
Sometimes you just can see (Incomprehensible)

They've stolen my wallet
Now I'm finally broke
Now I've finally got nothing to lose
Your picture was in it
The one thing that you left
With that photo I've lost you for good

I walk down to the port
Take my motorboat
And go out and turn the motor off

For those who choose to mouth the curse
A tragic serenade
With Judas in my stride
The Gothic halls of shame
Where statues coldly hold no worse
Than the murders I reclaim
From a dark, forsaken time

Kissing heaven, spent
He wipes lips free of his hectic discharge
Wishing to repent
For the brute that ravaged free
In slight hands beauty weeps
Conquest's deep methodical screwing
Hurt repeatedly
Like the world wound at his feet

Dirge Inferno

As it is written, damn it
So let it be wrung
From throats of those in overthrow
The past at last has come

A savage bit without respite
Pervades the freezing air
This winter chill, grist for his mill
If tears of joy will blear elsewhere
And church bells drown in the cracks of doom
The storms above us hew
As lightning runs like bifurcate tongues
Deflowering two by two

Hissing, malcontent
He storms the skies on electric discharge
Pissing in contempt
On the effigies of the weak
Killing all resolve
The great beast simmers, his scarlet women
Spit their vitriol
On the terrified face of peace

Dirge Inferno

As it is written, damn it
So let it be wrung
From throats of those in overthrow
Our past at last has come

A hellbound heart, the rose and thorn
Have locked to hasten blood
The moon disrobes, to harden droves
Of legions pouring
These rivers press, his breath adorns
Senates and enemy seats
Whilst his power takes as ingratitude
The writhing of the weak

""Wormwood my name
The poisoned star that fell to earth
And blistered free of shame
In the pits of self-rebirth
Now those caves become a farret
Overseeing endless barracks
As the waters turn to claret
And the Vatican satins burn"

Let's go where it's nice and quiet
Where there's nobody
There's nobody else around
Let's sit by a cozy lit fire
And we can be in each other's company
Now how does that sound to you?
You see, cause it sounds so good
It sounds so good to me

Come on and go with me
Would you do that, baby?
Come on over to my place
Would you do that, baby?

But don't you do it, baby

Nah, no, no
Come on over to my place
No, not tonight, no
You see it's not far from here
I believe you
Would you just take a minute and think about it?
Oh, man
Would you just think about it, think about it? Yeah
I'm thinkin' about it but I really have to say no

Come on and go with me
Come on over to my place
No, I know
You're sittin' here
You've been sittin' here for quite a long time
Yeah, I'm slightly bored, I hate bein' bored
See, I've been watchin' you
I've been doin' the same thing
I've had my eyes on you
I've been checkin' you out all night long
You look so nice and you look so sweet
Oh, thank you

Come on and go with me
That was sweet
You look like you oughta be with me
Come on, over to my place
Yeah, but what are you gonna with me? That's the problem
Seems that you feel the same way I do
I think it would pretty interesting
It seems that you need some company, too
Oh, boy
Yeah

Come on and go with me
You said your car is right out front, right out front
Come on, over to my place
And you're gonna bring me home after
But would it be all right with you?

Come on and go with me
If we left here and we went somewhere else, baby
Come on over to my place
Somewhere where it's nice and quiet, it's nice and quiet
That's nice, yeah, that sounds a little better than this place
Where we could sit down by a cozy lit fire
We could sip a little wine, work things out
Oh, yeah

Come on and go with me, work things out
Well, I cannot stay long
Come on over to my place
We got an hour, no more than that
Lady, you won't be under any kinda pressure
Please, I cannot stand pressure
I wouldn't do that, baby? No
Okay, well, would you get my coat?
See, I wouldn't do that, baby
See, I just wanna sit down
And get to know you a little better
Okay, just for a little while
I swear you look so good to me
Are you gonna pay for my drink?
Come on over to my place

How Jesus the savior, did come to die
To save lowly people like you and like I

Sweet Mary laid Jesus, within a cow's stall
Came wise men and farmers and shepherds and all
The blessings of Christmas heaven did fall
And God's promise of ages, to them did recall

If Jesus had wanted for any small thing
A cloud in the sky or a bird on the wing
Or all of God's angels in heaven to sing
He surely could have had it, because
He was the King
Because He was King!"

I got so much trouble on my mind
Refuse to lose
Here's your ticket;
Hear the drummer get wicked
The crew to you to push the back to Black attack
So I sack and jack, then slapped the Mac
Now I'm ready to mic it
(You know I like it) huh
Hear my favoritism roll ""Oh""
Never be a brother like, ""Me go solo""
Laser, anesthesia, maze ya
Ways to blaze your brain and train ya
The way I'm livin', forgiven, what I'm givin' up
X on the flex, hit me now
I don't know about later
As for now, I know how to avoid the paranoid
Man, I've had it up to here
Yeah, I wear got 'em going in fear
Rhetoric said and read just a bit ago
Not quitting, though signed the hard rhymer
Work to keep from getting jerked
Checkin' some ways (Ways)
To way back in the better days
Raw metaphysically bold, never followed a code
Still dropped a load
Never question what I am, God knows, huh!
'Cause it's coming from the heart
What I got, better get some
Get on up, hustler of culture
Snake bitten, been spit in the face, huh!
But the rhymes keep fittin'
Respect's been given, how's ya livin'
Now I can't protect, a paid-off defect
Check the record and reckon an intentional wreck
Played, off as some intellect
Made the call, took the fall, broke the laws
Not my fault that they're fallin' off
Known as fair and square throughout my years
So I growl at the livin' foul
Black to the bone, my home is your home
But welcome to the Terrordome

Cold deliverin' pain

Oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh Chuck, they out to get us, man!
Yo, we gotta dust these boys off!)
Crucifixion ain't no fiction
So-called chosen frozen
Apology made to whoever pleases
Still they got me like Jesus
I rather sing, bring, think, reminisce
'Bout a brother while I'm in sync
Every brother ain't a brother 'cause a color
Just as well could be undercover
Backstabbed, grabbed a flag from the back of the lab
Told a Rab get off the rag
Sad to say, I got sold down the river
Still some quiver when I deliver
Never to say I never knew or had a clue
Word was Herb, plus hard on the boulevard
Lies, scandalizin', basin'
Traits of hate, who's celebratin' with Satan?
I rope-a-dope the evil with righteous, bobbin' and weavin'
And let the good get even
C'mon down (C'mon!)
But welcome to the Terrordome

[Verse 3]
Caught in the race against time, the pit and the pendulum
Check the rhythm and rhymes while I'm bending 'em
Snakes blowing up the lines of design (Would you join me please in welcome-in-ing...)
Trying to blind the science I'm sending 'em
How to fight the power, cannot run and hide
But it shouldn't be suicide
In a game, a fool without the rules
Got a hell of a nerve to just criticize
Every brother ain't a brother
'Cause a black hand squeezed on Malcolm X the man
The shooting of Huey Newton
From a hand of a Nig who pulled the trig

Come on down

It's weak to speak and blame somebody else
When you destroy yourself
First, nothin' worse
Than a mother's pain of a son slain in Bensonhurst
Can't wait for the state to decide the fate
So this jam I dedicate
Places with the racist faces
Example, one of many places
Greek, week-end, speech, I speak
From a lesson, learned in Virginia
I don't smile in the line of fire, I go wildin'
But it's on bass and drums, even violins
Whatcha do, getcha head ready
Instead of getting physically sweaty
When I get mad, I put it down on a pad, huh!
Give ya something that ya never had
Controllin', fear of high rollin'
God bless your soul and keep livin'
Never allowed, kickin' it loud
Droppin' a bomb, brain game, intellectual Vietnam
Move as a team, never move alone

Eliminate the poor, how much longer will it take
Burning up the tents of the rank and file
Exterminate their lives, crack a demon smile

Getting rid of man's mistakes
To take a lost life, lock it up, break it down

Fight for anything, my country 'tis of me

Cry for absolution, it's not the end for me
A last minute pardon, one final reprieve
Resist the war machine, don't get in it's path
Fight to die a free man and reap the aftermath

I saw her today, I saw her face
Was the face I loved and I knew
I had to run away
And get down on my knees and pray-ay
That they'd go away
But still they begin...
Needles and pins
Needles and pins
Needles and pins...

[Verse 1]
I heard somebody fixed today
There was no last goodbyes to say
His will to live ran out
I heard somebody turned to dust
Looking back at what he left
A list of plans and photographs
Songs that never will be sung
These are the things he won't get done
The things he won't get done...

I've seen the man use the needle
Seen the needle use the man
I've seen them crawl from the cradle
To the gutter on their hands
They fight a war but it's fatal
It's so hard to understand
I've seen the man use the needle
Seen the needle use the man

[Verse 2]
Just one shot to say goodbye
One last taste to mourn and cry
Scores and shoots, the lights go dim
Just one shot to do him in
He hangs his head and wonders why
Why the monkey only lies, lies, lies...
But pay the pauper, he did choose
He hung his head inside the noose
He hung his head inside the noose, oh...

I've seen the man use the needle
Seen the needle use the man
I've seen them crawl from the cradle
To the coffin on their hands

Rambling out of the wild West
Leaving the towns I love the best
Thought I’d seen some ups and downs
'Til I come into New York town
People going down to the ground
Buildings going up to the sky

Wintertime in New York town
The wind blowing snow around
Walk around with nowhere to go
Somebody could freeze right to the bone
I froze right to the bone
New York Times said it was the coldest winter in seventeen years
I didn’t feel so cold then

[Verse 3]
I swung on to my old guitar
Grabbed hold of a subway car
And after a rocking, reeling, rolling ride
I landed up on the downtown side
Greenwich Village

[Verse 4]
I walked down there and ended up
In one of them coffeehouses on the block
I get on the stage to sing and play
Man there said, “Come back some other day
You sound like a hillbilly
We want folk singers here”

[Verse 5]
Well, I got a harmonica job, begun to play
Blowing my lungs out for a dollar a day
I blowed inside out and upside down
The man there said he loved my sound
He was raving about he loved my sound
A dollar a day’s worth

[Verse 6]
After weeks and weeks of hanging around
I finally got a job in New York town
In a bigger place, bigger money too
Even joined the union and paid my dues

[Verse 7]
Now, a very great man once said
That some people rob you with a fountain pen
It don’t take too long to find out
Just what he was talkin’ about
A lot of people don’t have much food on their table
But they got a lot of forks ’n’ knives
And they got to cut something

So one morning when the sun was warm
I rambled out of New York town
Pulled my cap down over my eyes
And headed out for the western skies

My mother didn't give me what I want, what the fuck?!

Kickin' niggas down the steps just for rep

Everybody hit the deck, Biggie 'bout to get some wreck
Quick to leave you in a coffin for slick talkin'
You better act like CeCe, and keep on walkin'
When I hit ya, I split ya to the white meat
You swung a left, you swung a right, you fell to the concrete
Your face, my feet, they meet with stompin'
I'm rippin' MC's from Tallahassee to Compton
Biggie Smalls on a higher plane
Niggas say I'm strange, deranged because I put the 12 gauge to your brain
Make your shit splatter
Mix the blood like batter then my pocket gets fatter
After the hit, leave you on the street with your neck slit
Down your backbone to where your motherfuckin' shit drip
The shit I kick rippin' through the vest, Biggie Smalls passin' any test
I'm ready to die!

Pray the Lord my soul to keep
If I should die before I wake

I don't know what the fuss is, my career is illustrious

Truth be told I had more fun when I was piss-poor
I'm pissed off, and this what success is all about?
A bunch of niggas acting like bitches with big mouths
All this stress, all I got is this big house
Couple of cars, I don't bring half of them shits out
All of this Ace of Spade I drink just to piss out
I mean, I like the taste, could've saved myself 6 hours
How many times can I go to Mr. Chow's, Tao's, Nobu?
Hold up, let me move my bowels
I'll shit on y'all niggas, OG, tell these boys
(Y'all ain't got shit on my nigga, aoww!)

Then ask: ""Why is life worth living?""
Is it to hunt for the shit that you want?
To receive's great, but I lust giving
The best jewelers wanna make my things
I make Jacob shit on Lorraine just to make me a chain
Niggas mentioned on One Love
Came home to the paper in hand
Ain't gotta brag about the Feds, young man
Old cribs I sold, y'all drive by like monuments
Google Earth Nas; I got flats in other continents
Worst enemies wanna be my best friends
Best friends wanna be enemies like that's what's in
But I don't give a fuck, walk inside the lion's den
Take everybody's chips, 'bout to cash them in

Bound by our greed
A nation enslaved as corporate tools
Arise and raze the legacy of their lies
To realize that this, in itself, is an ascension

As the seeds you've cast away take hold
War will be born
Rejoice, the age of the fall has begun
We'll dance as the palaces burn

You'll gain your just reward

Life...
Niggas used to come and get me
When it was time to disagree with an enemy
Pass the Hennessy it gives me energy
Packed the gat in the small of my back
Where these niggas at, I'll clear the whole pack
Talking shit cause I'm down for my set
I'm a vet, smoking on a wet cigarette
Who these niggas think they are
Wishing on a ghetto star, I represent my tar
I start busting and they scatter like water bugs
Cause these Westside niggas is harder thugs
Enslave us but nothing can save us from sporting Ben Davis
Shootin' at your neighbors
Cause sometimes I feel like a nut
Don’t give a fuck when I open you up
Hot rocks
Fly from the back seat
And busta-ass niggas run like a track meet
And if you caught in the middle
Bleed more than a little (what)
Killer King is the hospital
Feeling numb from the bullets I hum
And when they hit
Black mothers have fits

In slow mo’, .44 slugs, face down in the mud
Puddle full of blood
Left for dead, the pain starts to spread

I meet Doctor Who at King Drew medical center
As I enter I.C.U
He said the bullet hit a nerve that was vital
I said I can’t move my legs, he said don’t try to
Now this ain’t the end my friend but you'll probably never walk again

At night I jerk and jerk

Now everybody want to put they dope on me
Sayin I won't get searched by the LAPD

Depending on that to keep my ass alive

Got to beg the BG's to roll me up the hill
Put me on the porch

Smoking cocaine
Just to maintain
Nothing to gain nothing to lose
And last night I couldn’t make it to the bathroom
Feeling like a 2-year-old
You can’t get a sip from the brew I hold
It’s the only friend to a stranger

That pines to fly south
To this mouth of mine

Too long have these emotions
Like potions, made me
A sole castellan
Trusted to keep
The weight of oceans
From her rusted gates of sleep

A dreaming angel
Lying curled in the circles of Hell
I must protect her
Watch her back for any cracks to occur
For in the witching hour
She slips into the underworld
A pearled Persephone
Deflowered by the powers
Hat around her
Down her
Whirl

Doomed to damn the rift
Across the shifting abyss

I serve her slender hope
To preserve mankind from old ghosts
Disturbed though by recurring crimes
I sense that dead
Might be best for both

Posted to keep
Slow wheels in motion
From the human race to beat

Without her there
My nymphetamine with the faraway stare
Thin walls would crumble
Horrors would corroborate from dogstar lairs
For in the dead of the night
She spasms with orgasmic flare
This reamed Demeter
With Poseidons there inside her
Too appeased to grieve our air

Doomed to dam the rift
Across the shifting abyss

Forever sworn to keep it

Has incensed, made me
A wanton felon
Searching for the key
To loose her harness
And set desires lurching free

Thin walls would crumble
Horrors would corroborate from dogstar lair

I care not for the underworld
Slathering and gathering emboldened Reichs
To breach, to teach
A dread thereafter

Mankind, in his insatiable search for divine knowledge
Has discarded all Biblical teachings
Realizing that the strength of religion
Is the repression of knowledge
All structures of religion have collapsed
Life prays for death
In the wake of the horror of these revelations
It was never imagined how graphic the reality
That would be known as the end of creation
Would manifest itself
We believe all this chaos and atrocity can be traced
Back to one single event

All men are not created equal
Only the strong will prosper

Only in the darkness of Christ have I realized

There's a big, old world waiting just outside
As she's thumbing through the classifieds
Looking for work and any old job's okay

[Chorus]
Driving on that cross-town freeway hoping she might find
A whole lot more waiting up ahead than what she left behind
Living upstairs, downtown
Life's too short to be hanging around
She's eighteen and it's time she got out of the wood
She's getting out while the getting's good

[Verse 3]
Then she lost her job at the grocery store
And the wolf came knocking at the door
The red notice said they turned off her telephone
There's nothing left for her to do so she's packed up a thing or two
Loaded her car down, now she's headed home

[Chorus]
Driving on that two lane road hoping she might find
A whole lot more waiting up ahead than what she left behind
Living upstairs, downtown
Life's too short to be hanging around
She's eighteen and it's time she got back to the wood
She's getting out while the getting's good"

Tied up in chains so tight

[Verse 1]
Each day, my shortcomings pick my pockets
My faults were letters carved in stone
As meaningful to you as words written in water
I'm left to walk this world alone
In a broken mold they made me
The black sheep of the family
Worth less than zero
My opinion and room temperature IQ
I did something, now I'm nothing
Always wrong with this or that
Poisoned with fear
Watch it twist my measly brain mad

[Verse 2]
Talk about me when my back is turned
Next time we meet, it will be too late
The memory burnt in my ears of what you said
And now I've got a recipe for hate, taste it
Dark clouds on the horizon make it hard to breathe
A walking mistake
But every time I run away
I just come back for more
The choice is clear
I can quit and fall on my sword
Or light a fire to see who runs or stays
And plays the confidence game

Part II: Warhorse

[Verse 3]
I'm feeling quite invisible
I feel just like thin air
The truth taunts me
That nobody wants me
I see the Earth below me
I watch it spin there
Does someone somewhere out there hear me?
Sentenced to walk in purgatory
My life is running down
I can't believe what they've done to me

How each of us dreams to understand anything at all
Why each of us decides, I've never been sure
The part we take, the way we are
Why each of us denies every other way in the world

However unsure, however unwise, day after day play out our lives
However confused, pretending to know to the end
But this isn't truth, this isn't right, this isn't love, this isn't life
This isn't real, this is a lie

Blood is boiling
Taste copper on my tongue

Welcome it with a smile

Something's very strange

Suffocating, no one hears my calls
Never-ending, 'til the black curtain falls

It's just me against the world
Nothin' to lose
It's just me against the world, baby
I got nothin' to lose
It's just me against the world
Stuck in the game
Me against the world, baby

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Can you picture my prophecy?
Stress in the city, the cops is hot for me
The projects is full of bullets
Though bodies is droppin' there ain't no stoppin' me
Constantly movin' while makin' millions
Witnessin' killings, leavin' dead bodies in abandoned buildings
Can't reach the children, 'cause they're illin'
Addicted to killin' and the appeal from the cap peelin'
Without feelin', but will they last or be blasted?
Hard-headed bastard, maybe he'll listen in his casket
The aftermath: more bodies bein' buried
I'm losin' my homies in a hurry, they're relocatin' to the cemetery
Got me worried, stressin', my vision's blurry
The question is will I live, no one in the world loves me
I'm headed for danger, don't trust strangers
Put one in the chamber whenever I'm feelin' this anger
Don't wanna make excuses
'Cause this is how it is, what's the use?
Unless we're shootin', no one notices the youth
It's just me against the world, baby

[Chorus: 2Pac & Puff Johnson]
Me against the world
It's just me against the world
It's just me against the world
Me against the world
'Cause it's just me against the world, baby (Hey)
Me against the world (Ooh yeah)
I got nothin' to lose
It's just me against the world, baby
I got nothin' to lose

[Verse 2: Yaki Kadafi]
Could somebody help me? I'm out here all by myself, see
Ladies in stores, Baby Capone's, livin' wealthy
Pictures of my birth on this Earth is what I'm dreamin'
Seein' Daddy's semen, full of crooked demons
Already crazy and screamin', I guess them nightmares as a child
Had me scared but left me prepared for a while
Is there another route for a crooked Outlaw?
Veteran, a villain, a young thug, who one day shall fall

[Verse 3: E.D.I. Mean]
Everyday there's mo' death, and plus I'm dough-less
I'm seein' more reasons for me to proceed with thievin'
Scheme on the schemin' and leave they peeps grievin'
'Cause ain't no bucks to stack up
My nuts is backed up, I'm about to act up
Go load the MAC up, now watch me klacka
Tried makin' fat cuts, but yo, it ain't workin'
And evil's lurkin', I can see him smirkin' when I gets to pervin'
So what? Go put some work in and make my mail
Makin' sales, riskin' 25 with a L, but oh well

[Chorus: 2Pac & Puff Johnson]

With all this extra stressin'
The question I wonder is after death, after my last breath
When will I finally get to rest through this oppression?
They punish the people that's askin' questions
And those that possess steal from the ones without possessions
The message I stress: to make it stop, study your lessons
Don't settle for less, even the genius asks his questions
Be grateful for blessings
Don't ever change, keep your essence
The power is in the people and politics we address
Always do your best, don't let this pressure make you panic
And when you get stranded
And things don't go the way you planned it
Dreamin' of riches, in a position of makin' a difference
Politicians are hypocrites, they don't wanna listen
If I'm insane, it's the fame made a brother change
It wasn't nothin' like the game; it's just me against the world

[Chorus: 2Pac & Puff Johnson]
Me against the world
Nothin' to lose
It's just me against the world, baby
Me against the world
Got me stuck in the game (Ooh yeah)
It's just me against the world
Nothin' to lose
It's just me against the world, baby
Me against the world

It was a hell of a ride
Don't need to say let's be friends
Don't need to promise you'll write

We rode that train through the night
And never cared where it went
If I don't see you again
If I don't see you again

We ran a whole other race
Two strangers meet on the road
And find a time and a place
We never once had to lie
We've passed the age of conscent
If I don't see you again

I know it's crazy out there
My head is sleeping around
I went out looking for love
And never liked what I found

Don't pay to make it alone
God knows it's lonely out there
I made it once on my own
And hardly anyone cared
If I don't see you again

Who you gonna run to baby
Who you gonna hide behind when the nights
It's suddenly cold
Who's gonna hold you
Who's gonna love you
Who will you go to

Who you gonna call if it ain't me
When you're feeling lost
And there is nobody out there
Looking for you
What will you do
Where will you go
If I don't see you again
If I don't see you again

You made it happen somehow
I think I gave up on life
But I feel better right now
Something you see turn around
Don't need to know what you meant
If I don't see you again

And at the end of the day
I hated sleeping alone
There's nothing worse when you're lost
And you don't wanna go home
It's gonna work out some way
I just don't wanna be found
I'm waiting here round the bay
And I'll be hanging around
If I don't see you again

Who am I kidding
I'm going nowhere
I can't even get through
An hour without you
Should be ashamed
Just wanna hear you
Calling my name

Two of those missed conventions
These men must have somehow missed something more
Cause we're here alone
I know we're together
To fall apart
I know how to get back home
Each time we say that
Cause you're frustrated too long
You've been too lonely to know
To find that something is wrong

The time if perfect to go
Before the curtain descents
Right now when both of us know
That everything has got to end
If I don't see you again

What's it gonna come to baby
Who you gonna hide behind when the nights
Get filled up with dirt
Looking to run
You're running away
And when you came on to save me
Doesn't look like the future is clear
I need you to hear me
Praying to
But nobody hears me
I had a plan to the moon
Each time you're saying good bye
Cause if I stayed for too long
You get too lonely to work
To find that something was wrong

The time is perfect to go
Before the curtain descents
Right now when both of us know
Everything has got to end
If I don't see you again
If I don't see you again

Somehow we both made it through
I would have gave up on life
Before I gave up on you
You went and turned me around
Could be with something you said
I couldn't make out the sound

When I get older losing my hair
Many years from now
Will you still be sending me a valentine
Birthday greetings, bottle of wine?
If I'd been out till quarter to three
Would you lock the door?
Will you still need me, will you still feed me
When I'm sixty-four?

Oooh, you'll be older too
And if you say the word
I could stay with you (Aaaah)

I could be handy mending a fuse
When your lights have gone
You can knit a sweater by the fireside
Sunday mornings go for a ride
Doing the garden, digging the weeds
Who could ask for more?
Will you still need me, will you still feed me
When I'm sixty-four?

Every summer we can rent a cottage
In the Isle of Wight, if it's not too dear
We shall scrimp and save (We shall scrimp and save)

Send me a postcard, drop me a line
Stating point of view
Indicate precisely what you mean to say
Yours sincerely, wasting away
Give me your answer, fill in a form
Mine for evermore

Use my steel toe as a weapon
Kick ya and flip ya, now they want to
Label this nigga tape with the sticker
Diggin' out girls that's nicety
Plus I got a body count like Ice-T

Through with Daryl Gates but is Willie Williams
Down with the pilgrims?
Just a super slave
We'll have to break his ass up like Super Dave
I'm wicked enough to pull this
'Cause now it's on to the fullest
Gorilla straight from the mist
But I don't miss when it comes to (Uh) this
Bring the yellow tape

Take this job and stick it, bigot, 'cause I get wicked

And my name is Don Jagwarr, we are the top celebrity seen
Because we wicked, we wicked, we pick up di mics
Yes, we wicked, we wicked, we put down di guns
Yes, dem wicked, dem wicked, but we run di town

We are gathered here today
To get through this thing called ""life""
Electric word, life
It means forever, and that's a mighty long time

The afterworld
A world of never ending happiness
You can always see the sun, day or night
So when you call up that shrink in Beverly Hills
You know the one, Dr. Everything'll-Be-All-Right
Instead of asking him how much of your time is left
Ask him how much of your mind, babe

Things are much harder than in the afterworld

And if de-elevator tries to bring you down
Go crazy (Punch a higher floor)

The world you're living in

For a friendly word

Dropped it on the floor
""Ah, ah,"" is all I heard

Until they put us in the truck, let's go
Come..

But we don't know why
Maybe it's 'cause
We're all gonna die
And when we do (When we do)
What's it all for? (What's it all for?)
You better live now
'Fore the grim reaper come knocking on your door

They sort of develop a taste for blood
Yeah, that's right
They kill one man, or kill ten
It's all the same (Yes)
After all, they can only hang you once

[Verse 1: Ghostface Killah]
Both hands clusty, chillin' with my man Rusty
Low down, blew off the burner, kinda dusty
The world can't touch Ghost, purple tape, Rae co-host
Monty Hall expo, intellect, you read pro
Son's triflin' fuck, wildflower on the cycle and
Picked up the broom thought I was Michael-in'
West Brighton Pool, now I'm into Iron Duels
Turn nuns to Earths, Whoopi, she at Allah school
Inhale break beats of Hell a-alikes propel parallel
Duracell knot, you flashed a burnt cell
Snap out of Candyland, kids, the old rumor is
Blacks become immune and shit, we never did
Like eating dead birds, trust the pharmacy over herbs
Men marrying men, ill they got the urge, pulsar
Scissor hand wig vanished in the winter, living off land
You god damn right I fuck fans, king me
Check, checkmate, props like the micro chip founder
Neck to neck stock with Bill Gates now

[Bridge: Ghostface Killah]
When we hug these mics we get busy (Busy)
Come and have a good time with G-O-D (G-O-D)
Make you snap your fingers or wiggle (Wiggle)

Shake that body, party that body
Don't fuck with Ghost, you'll feel sorry
That's word, I'm not the herb
Understand what I'm saying, saying, saying?

[Verse 2: Ghostface Killah]
Hit mics like Ted Koppel, rifle expert
Let off the Eiffel, burn a flag in your grass, spiteful
Ringleader set it off, rap Derek Jeter
Culprit, prince of the game, wish you could see us
We lay low, glitter wax full bangles
Priceless ropes, lay around the God, get tangled
Woolly hair, eyes fiery red, feet made of brass
Twelve men following me, it be the God staff
Move, every script's like Miramax
Smashed the big boy, totaled it, Wilshire and Fairfax
Sun beamin', wifey on the beach sipping Zima
Wu 'binos to Latinos, we love Selena
Overnight, God schedules, FedEx
Pretty silhouette, velvet nice, DNA scroll genetics
Too hot to handle, one thought from scrambling the mandolin
Hundred game Wilt Chamberlain, smack 'em, say when
He rollin' up, face wrinkled up, hands is on his nuts
Yo kid, stop fronting on the grounds 'fore you get touched
It's Canada Dry sess with Allah, son
We want rye, we want it so bad we might cry

For every blow, depends on breath control
So it's the first thing you must learn

I remember sista Maggie, breasts were kinda saggy
Used to sell me buddha outta fucked up little baggies
Honey'd up a twenty even when I had no money
She said ""Pay me back with some Latin dick Sonnie""
Well I never went out, and I don't think I'm gonna
Just for some buddha, she wanted me to bone her
""Demeaning, ya think ya know what I meanin''
I got somethin' for the ho's ta be schemin' on
I'm the Buddha-Real I take a trip ta hoota'ville
I'll throw ya out the door... of my big blue Seville
Then light another joint, this ain't no exploitation (point)
For we are the ones strollin' in the ways of the masters

And I like, take my time, but it just doesn't work out the way I want it to

It never turns out
It's like, I need time to figure these things out

""Hey Mike, you know, we've been noticing you've been having a lot of problems lately, you know?
You should maybe get away
And like, maybe you should talk about it, you'll feel a lot better""

Just leave me alone, I'll figure it out, you know?

Madness comes and madness goes
An insane place with insane moves
Battles without for battles within
Where evil lives and evil rules
Breaking them up, just breaking them in
Quickest way out, quickest relief wins
Never disclose, never betray

And when you kill a man you're a murderer
Kill many, and you're a conqueror
Kill them all... ooh, oh, you're a God!

Catch a flight to St. Louis

Four gang bangers, professional crack slangers
Rented a car at wholesale
Drove to the ghetto, and checked in a motel
Unpacked and I grab the three-eighty

Goddamn, it's a brand new payback
From the straight gangsta mack in straight gangsta black
How many motherfuckers gotta pay?
Went to the shelf and dusted off the AK
Caps gotta get peeled
Cause ""The Nigga Ya Love to hate"" still can ""Kill at Will""
It ain't no pop cause that sucks
And you can New Jack Swing on my nuts
Down wit' the niggas that I bail out
I'm platinum, bitch, and I didn't have to sell out
""Fuck you, Ice Cube"", that's what the people say
Fuck America, still with the triple K
'Cause you know when my nine goes buck
It'll bust your head like a watermelon dropped from twelve stories up
Now let's see who'll drop
Punk motherfuckers tryin' to ban hip-hop
Fuck R&B and the runnin' man
I'm the one that stand, with the gun in hand
Make sure before you buck wit' duck quick
Punk, 'cause I'm the wrong nigga to fuck with
(""I'ma let y'all know one thing man"")

[Verse 2: Ice Cube]
Hell yeah it's on, you better tell 'em
Ice Cube and I'm rolling with the motherfuckin' L.M
It's the number one crew in the area
Make a move for your gat and I'll bury ya
Ashes to ashes, dirt to dirt
Punks roll when I put in work
'Cause Lench Mob niggas are the craziest
And y'all motherfuckers can't fade my shit
South Central, that's where the Lench Mob dwell
Hittin' fools up with the big ass L
One time can't hold me back
Sweatshirt, khakis and croaker sacs
Stop givin' juice to the Raiders
Cause Al Davis never paid us
I hope he wear a vest
It's all about the L-E-N-C-H y'all know the rest
Muthafuckin' crew, muthafuckin' mob
Do a muthafuckin' job in a muthafuckin' squad
In '91, Ice Cube grew stronger and bigger
And I'm the wrong nigga to fuck with
(""One-and-two, ah-three-e-and-ah-four-and"")
(""Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute"")
Drop a old school beat

[Verse 3: Ice Cube]
Like I said, it's a brand new payback
Now in '91, let's see whose beats get jacked
Sir Jinx grew a little bit taller
(Keep the wack beats out)
True motherfuckin' baller
And hoes can't roll on
Even bitches looking like En Vogue gotta ""Hold On""
Don't let me catch Daryl Gates in traffic
I gotta have it, to peel his cap backwards
I hope he wear a vest too, and his best blue
Goin' up against the Zulu
Break his spine like a jellyfish
Kick his ass 'til I'm smellin' shit
Off with the head, off with the head I say
And watch the devil start kickin'
Run around like a chicken
Grand Dragon finger lickin'
Yo, turn him over with a spatula
Now we got, Kentucky Fried Cracker
Mess with the Cube, you get punked quick
Pig, cause I'm the wrong nigga to fuck with

Oh, yeah— it ain't over, motherfuckers
The motherfuckin' saga continues
Y'all motherfuckers ready for N.W.A? Well, get the fuck up
A bitch is a bitch, so if you're poor—
It was once said by a man who couldn't quit, dope—
Ice Cube writes the rhymes that I say
But now, since he stepped the fuck off
Here's what they think about you
That punk Ice Cube—
Here's what they think about you
Cube was suckin' so much New York dick
Here's what they think about you

Here's what they think about you

Here's what they think about you
When they was in London, they wasn't no good without fuckin' Ice Cube

Fuck all y'all

[Verse 1]
Goddamn, I'm glad y'all set it off
Used to be hard, now you're just wet and soft
First you was down with the AK
And now I see you on a video with Michel'le
Looking like straight bozos
I saw it coming, that's why I went solo
And kept on stompin'
While y'all motherfuckers moved straight outta Compton
Living with the whites
One big house and not another nigga in sight
I started off with too much cargo
Dropped four niggas, now I'm making all the dough
White man just ruling
The Niggas With Attitudes? Who you foolin'?
Y'all niggas just phony
I put that on my mama and my dead homies
Yella Boy's on your team, so you're losing
Ayy, yo, Dre, stick to producing
Calling me Arnold, but you been a dick
Eazy-E saw your ass and went in it quick
You got jealous when I got my own company
But I'm a man and ain't nobody humping me
Trying to sound like Amerikkka's Most
You could yell all day, but you don't come close
'Cause you know I'm the one that flow
You done run a hundred miles, but you still got one to go
With the L-E-N-C-H M-O-B
And y'all disgrace the C-P-T
'Cause you're getting fucked out your green
By a white boy, with no Vaseline

Now you're getting done without Vaseline
Now you're getting done without Vaseline
Now you're getting done without Vaseline
Damn, it feels good to see people, on it
[Verse 2]
The bigger the cap, the bigger the peeling
Who gives a fuck about a punk-ass villain?
You're getting fucked real quick
And Eazy dick is smelling like MC Ren's shit
Tried to tell you a year ago
But Willie D told me to let a ho be a ho, so
I couldn't stop you from getting ganked
Now let's play big bank take little bank
Tried to diss Ice Cube, it wasn't worth it
'Cause the broomstick fit your ass so perfect
Cut my hair? Nah, cut them balls
'Cause I heard you like giving up the drawers
Gang-banged by your manager, fella
Getting money out your ass like a motherfucking ready teller
Giving up the dollar bills
Now they got The Villain with a purse and high-heels
So don't believe what Ren say
'Cause he's going out like Kunta Kinte
But I got a whip for you, Toby
Used to be my homie, now you act like you don't know me
It's a case of divide and conquer
'Cause you let a Jew break up my crew
House nigga gotta run and hide
Yelling Compton, but you moved to Riverside
So don't front, MC Ren
'Cause I remember when you drove a B210
Broke as a motherfucking joke
Let you on the scene to back up the first team
It ain't my fault, one nigga got smart
And they ripping your asshole apart
By taking your green
Oh, yeah, The Villain does get fucked with no Vaseline

Now you're getting done— get— getting done
Now you're getting done— get— getting done
Now you're getting done without Va— Va— Va— Va— Vaseline

I never have dinner with the president
I never have dinner with the president
I never have dinner with the president
And when I see your ass again, I'll be hesitant
Now I think you a snitch
Throw a house nigga in a ditch
Half pint bitch, fucking your homeboys, you little maggot
Eazy-E turned faggot
With your manager, fella
Fucking MC Ren, Dr. Dre, and Yella
But if they were smart as me
Eazy-E would be hanging from a tree
With no Vaseline
Just a match and a little bit of gasoline
Light 'em up, burn 'em up, flame on
'Til that Jheri curl is gone
On a permanent vacation
Off the massa plantation
Heard you both got the same bank account
Dumb nigga, what you thinking 'bout?
Get rid of that devil real simple
Put a bullet in his temple
'Cause you can't be the Nigga 4 Life crew
With a white Jew telling you what to do
Pulling wools with your scams
Now I gotta play The Silence of the Lambs
With a midget who's a punk too
Tryin' to fuck me, but I'd rather fuck you

""At the bottom of our news tonight, there's been a new animal aimed in the direction of falling off the face of the Earth. Yes, young black teenagers are reported to be the oldest, and the newest, creatures added to the endangered species list. As of now, no efforts have been made to preserve the Blacks. When asked why, a top law official adds, 'Because they make good game hunting'""
(A young nigga got it bad cause I'm brown)

[Verse 1: Ice Cube]
Peace? Hahaha, don't make me laugh!
All I hear is motherfuckers rappin' succotash
Livin' large, tellin' me to get out the gang
I'm a nigga, gotta live by the trigga
How the fuck do you figure
That I can say ""Peace"" and the gunshots will cease?
Every cop killing goes ignored
They just send another nigga to the morgue
A point scored, they could give a fuck about us
They rather catch us with guns and white powder
If I was old, they'd probably be a friend of me
Since I'm young, they consider me the enemy
They kill ten of me to get the job correct
To serve, protect, and break a nigga's neck
Cuz I'm the one with the trunk of funk
And ""Fuck tha Police"" in the tape deck
You should listen to me cuz there's more to see
Call my neighborhood a ghetto cuz it houses minorities
The other color don't know you can run but not hide
These are tales from the darkside

All of us are endangered, damn!

[Verse 2: Ice Cube]
You wanna free Africa? I'll stare at ya
Cuz we ain't got it too good in America
I can't fuck with them overseas
My homeboy died over ki's
Of cocaine, it was plain and simple
The 9mm went (buck) to the temple
(Buck, buck, buck) was the sound I put the bitch down
And ran to the schoolyard bathroom
Looked in the trash can, yo it had room
So I ducked my ass in it for a minute
Covered with trash I had to lay back
Mad as fuck, thinkin' about the payback
Tonight, the crew had a little fun
I went home and cut the barrel off my shotgun
It's gettin' critical - I stole a 5.0
I let it go - drive real slow
I yelled out ""Ice Cube, sucka""
The shotgun kicked, and it murdered motherfuckers
I told you last album
""When I got a sawed-off, bodies are hauled off""
Its a shame, that niggas die young
But to the light side it don't matter none
It'll be a drive by homicide
But to me its just another tale from the darkside

[Segue: Sampled guitar riff]
[Verse 3: Chuck D]
Standing in the middle of war, the minute we flex
When we die, we won't make Jet
Ebony can't see to the light side
The term they apply to us is a nigga
Call it what you want, cause I'm comin’ from the corner
Same applies to a Ph.D
Who's black - don't wanna roll - sells his soul
Watch his head go rollin’
Who the fuck are they foolin’?
Nobody knows, but I suppose the color of my clothes
Matches the color of the one on my face
As they wonder whats under my waist
(Standin' on the verge) of them gettin’ brown
That's a fact, got a fear of the bozack
Run, run, run, their ass off, they can not hide
Yeah Cube, they can't fuck with the darkside!"

Goodbye

Everything is 3D blasphemy
My eyes are red and gold, the hair is standing straight up
This is not the way I pictured me
I can't control my shakes, how the hell did I get here?
Something about this, so very wrong
I have to laugh out loud, I wish I didn't like this
Is it a dream or a memory?

But I'm a victim, Manchurian candidate
I have sinned by just
Makin' my mind up and takin' your breath away

Goodbye
You haven't learned a thing
I haven't changed a thing
The flesh was in my bones
The pain was always free
You haven't learned a thing
I haven't changed a thing
The flesh was in my bones
The pain was always free

I'm a soldier
I'm a soldier
Yo

[Verse 1]
Never was a thug, just infatuated with guns
Never was a gangsta 'til I graduated to one
And got the rep of a villain, for weapon concealin'
Took the image of a thug, kept shit appealin'
Willin' to stick out my neck for respect
If it meant life or death, never live to regret what I said
When you're me, people just wanna see if it's true
If it's you—what you say in your raps, what you do
So they feel it's part of your obligation to fulfill
When they see you on the streets, face to face, are you for real?
In confrontation, ain't no conversation, if you feel
You're in violation, any hesitation'll get you killed
If you feel it, kill it; if you conceal it, reveal it
Being reasonable'll leave you full of bullets, pull it
Squeeze it 'til it's empty; tempt me, push me, pussies
I need a good reason to give this trigger a good squeeze

They won't budge, I'll never fall or fold up

Pistol-whippin' motherfucking bouncers 6'2""
Who needs bullets? As soon as I pull it, you sweat bullets
An excellent method to get rid of the next bully
It's actually better 'cause instead of you murderin'
You can hurt 'em and come back again and kick dirt at 'em
It's like pourin' salt in the wounds, assault and get sued
You can smell the lawsuits soon as I waltz in the room
Everybody halts and stops, calls the cops
All you see is bitches comin' out their halter tops
Runnin' and duckin' out the Hot Rocks parking lot
You'll all get shot, whether it's your fault or not, 'cause I'm a—

Give it back to these damn critics and sock it to 'em

You motherfuckers could never do it like I could do it
Don't even try it, you'll look stupid, do not pursue it
Don't ever in your life try to knock the truest
I spit the illest shit ever been dropped in two-inch
So ticky-tock, listen as the sound ticks on the clock
Listen to the sound of Kim as she licks on a cock
Listen to the sound of me spillin' my heart through this pen
Motherfuckers know that I'll never be Marshall again
Full of controversy until I retire my jersey
'Til the fire inside dies and expires at thirty

Blackened heart baptized in fire
Exertion now, need to blitz
Vicious ways brought up in Hell
Draw the line, life or death
Potent thrust, excessive pain
Massive dose, adrenaline
Minor threat cannot decline

Stricken to live, Hell on Earth
Shackled and bound we lie
Praise of death, life's a dream
We're only living to die

Victim of life, insanity lives
Deep in shock, intensive care
Tables turned, blast of strength
Kill at once, time to prevail
Begin to crank, feel the rush
Start to rage, take to extremes
Push too far, overkill
Time to die, no way to win

Takin' a life or two, that's what the hell I do

Walked over to 'em, and said, ""What's up?""
The first nigga that I saw, hit him in the jaw
Ren started stompin' him, and so did E
By that time, got rushed by security
Out the door, but we don't quit
Ren said ""Let's start some shit!""
I got a shotgun, and here's the plot:
Takin' niggas out with a flurry of buck shots
Boom! Boom! Boom! Yeah, I was gunnin'
And then you look, all you see is niggas runnin'
And fallin' and yellin' and pushin' and screamin' and cussin'

See a nigga on Dayton's and we creep
Real slow, and before you know
I had my shotgun pointed in the window
He got scared and hit the gas
Right then I knew I had to smoke his ass
He kept rollin', I jumped in the bucket
We couldn't catch him, so I said fuck it
Then we headed right back to the fort
Sweatin' all the bitches in the biker shorts
We didn't get no play from the ladies
With six niggas in a car; are you crazy?
She was scared, and it was showin'
We all said, ""Fuck you, bitch!"" and kept goin'
To the hood, and we was fin' to
Find somethin' else to get into
Like some pussy, or in fact
A bum rush, but we call it rat pack
On a nigga for nothin' at all

A day or two ago, I thought I'd take a ride
And soon Miss Fanny Bright was seated by my side
The horse was lean and lank, misfortune seemed his lot
He got into a drifted bank, oh, we may got caught

Oh, jingle bells, jingle bells jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh, hey

Now the ground is white, go it while you're young
Take the girls tonight and sing this sleighing song
Just get a bob-tailed bay, two-forty as his speed
Hitch him to an open sleigh and, ""Crack,"" you'll take the lead

[Chorus]
Oh, jingle bells, jingle bells jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh
I'm singing, jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way

She runs this space station and bake shop down near Boomtown
She told me that human beings are flawed individuals
That the cosmic bakers took us out of the oven a little too early
And that's the reason we're as crazy as we are, and I believe it!
Take for example, when you go to the movies these days
You know, they try to sell you this jumbo drink
8 extra ounces of watered-down Cherry Coke
For an extra 25 cents. I don't want it
I don't want that much organization in my life
I don't want other people thinking for me
I want my Junior Mints
Where did the Junior Mints go in the movies?
I don't want a 12 lb. Nestle's crunch for 25 dollars
I WANT JUNIOR MINTS!
We need more fruitcakes in this world and less bakers!
We need people that care!

When Leonard finally came to California
He was twenty-one years old, as I recall
He loved to write a song and pick the guitar
And he came to hang a gold one on the wall

The town in which he lived is not important
But you'll know which town I mean by the time I'm through
He soon became a famous entertainer
But Leonard was a name he never used

He was on his way to having what he wanted
Just about as close as one could be
Hey, once he even followed Elvis Presley
And he wrote a lot of country songs for me
But he laid it all aside to follow Jesus
For years, he chose to let his music go
But preaching wasn't really meant for Leonard
But how in the hell was Leonard supposed to know?

Well, life began to twist its way around him
And I wondered how he carried such a load
He came back again to try his luck in music
And lost his wife and family on the road

After that he seemed to bog down even deeper
And I saw what booze and pills could really do
And I wondered if I'd ever see him sober
But I'd forgot about a friend that Leonard knew

Well, Leonard gave me lots of inspiration
He helped teach me how to write a country song
And he even brought around a bag of groceries
Hey, back before Muskogee came along

Really I'm not trying to hide his show name
Or the town in which this episode began
Somehow I had to write a song for old Tommy
If just to see the smiling faces in the band

Well, when Leonard finally came to California
He was twenty-one years old, as I recall
And he loved to write a song and pick the guitar
And he came to hang a gold one on the wall"

And filled with laughter
And sometimes they cried
Sometimes there was a fire
Of Holy anger in Jesus' eyes

But the eyes that saw hope in the hopeless
That saw through the fault to the need
Are the same eyes that look down from heaven
Into the deepest part of you and me

And His eyes are always upon us
His eyes never close in sleep
And no matter where you go
You will always be in His eyes
In His eyes

Sometimes His voice comes calling
Like rolling thunder
Or like driving rain
And sometimes His voice is quiet
And we start to wonder
If He knows our pain

But He who spoke peace to the water
Cares more for our hearts than the waves
And the voice that once said, ""You're forgiven""
Still says, ""You're forgiven"", today, today

Sometimes I look above me
When stars are shining
And I feel so small
How could the God of heaven
And all creation
Know I'm here at all

But then in the silence, He whispers
""My child, I created you too
And you're My most precious creation
I even gave My Son for you""

And His eyes are always upon you
His eyes never close in sleep
And no matter where you go
You will always be in His eyes
No matter where you go
You will always be in His eyes

In a small Kentucky town
I drew my first breath one cold November morning
And before my feet even touched the ground
With the doctors and the nurses gathered 'round
I started to dance, I started to dance

A little boy full of wide-eyed wonder
Footloose and fancy free
But it would happen, as it does for every dancer
That I'd stumble on a truth I couldn't see
And find a longing deep inside of me, it said

I am the heart, I need the heartbeat
I am the eyes, I need the sight
I realize that I am just a body
I need the life
I move my feet, I go through the motions
But who'll give purpose to chance
I am the dancer
I need the Lord of the dance

The world beneath us spins in circles
And this life makes us twist and turn and sway
But we were made for more than rhythm with no reason
By the one who moves with passion and with grace
As He dances over all that He has made

I am the heart, He is the heartbeat
I am the eyes, He is the sight
And I see clearly, I am just a body
He is the life
I move my feet, I go through the motions
But He gives purpose to chance
I am the dancer
He is the Lord of the dance
Lord of the dance
Lord of the dance

And while the music of His love and mercy plays
I will fall down on my knees and I will pray

I am the heart, You are the heartbeat
I am the eyes, You are the sight
And I see clearly, I am just a body
You are the life
I move my feet, I go through the motions
But You give purpose to chance

And the broken-hearted will finally heal
You will be judged and you will be found wanting

Nigga, my gun go off - you see the barrel turning
You feel the hollows burning, nigga, now you're learning
Nigga, my gun go off - call it attempted murder
Nigga, I'm trying to murk you when I come back busting
Nigga, my gun go off - don't try to say I'm tripping
When I get to flipping and I smack the clip in
Nigga, my gun go off - we call it putting work in
Leaving niggas hurting, homicide's lurking
Nigga, my gun go off

[Verse 1]
Fuckboy, you can see it to believe it
Try to dodge and weave it, end up a paraplegic
Believe me, its easy, I'll hurt you, I'll murk you
I'll pop something, drop something, I ain't going to stop hunting
Run, run, 'til you're spun, one shot, one gun
One 911 emergency, it's murder, B
It's excellent execution when I'm pulling the trigger
No mistake for that cake, I'm hitting you and your niggas
Feel the flame when I aim for the top of your brain
See the spark and the bang, nigga, shit ain't a game
Do the math or get blast, bullets go through the glass
Goes through your ass fast and the leather seat in your Nav
Nigga, its not a war when there's casualties on one side, I ride
Turn it up on you nigga after Jake ride by
I click-clack, that's that, I don't flash, I mash
I wave the Uzi at them, I make a movie out them

You better lose yourself in the moment
Use it, fuck the music, I'mma let it go
You only get one shot before I back out and fire back
At your hat, your back, your ass crack, your nutsack
Your Cadillac, if you make it to that, I'm hitting that
The 70's was smack, the 80's crack
The 90's was grimy, millennium MACs, man
Clips on the whips I ride in them, bad bitches, I ride in them
Don't worry, I'll get them, gat's jammed or unjammed
God damn safest the safety don't work, squeeze the eagle, it chirps
End up faced down in the dirt more than hurt
Bring the beef where you hang out, bang out, shots ring out
Hit your shoulders trying to blow your brains out
Hit your homies in their legs, bet they have their canes out tomorrow
You know tomorrow's just a day away
If you can keep your heart beating, then your ass awake

A subjective mannequin
Beaten into submission

Dangling in distress
Here to discipline

Bleeding on your knees
My satisfaction is what I need
The urge to take my fist

Beaten into submission
Raping again and again

Scream to your heart's content

Power so insane
Trying to circumvent
Unadulterated battery
Manipulated reality

Ten years ago I used to listen to rappers flow
Talkin' bout the way they rocked the mic at the disco
I liked how that shit was goin' down
Dreamt about ripping the mic with my own sound
So I tried to write rhymes something like them
My boys said, ""That ain't you, Ice! That shit sounds like them.""
So I sat back, thought up a new track
Didn't fantasize, kicked the pure facts
Motherfuckers got scared cause they was unprepared
Who would tell it how it really was? Who dared?
A motherfucker from the West Coast, L.A
South Central, fool, where the Crips and the Bloods play
When I wrote about parties, it didn't fit
""6 N' the Mornin,"" that was the real shit

[Hook]
O.G. Original Gangster

[Verse 2]
When I wrote about parties, someone always died
When I tried to write happy, yo, I knew I lied
'Cause, I lived a life of crime Why play ya blind?
A simple look and anyone with two cents would know I'm
A hardcore player from the streets
Rapping bout hardcore topics over hardcore drum beats
A little different than the average though
Jet you through the fast lane, drop ya on death row
Cause anybody who's been there knows that
Life ain't so lovely on the blood-soaked fast track
That invincible shit don't work
Throw ya in a joint, you'll be coming out feet first
So I blast the mic with my style
Sometimes I'm ill and other times buckwild
But the science is always there
I'd be a true sucker if I acted like I didn't care
I rap for brothers just like myself
Dazed by the game in a quest for extreme wealth
But I kick it to you hard and real
One wrong move, and your cap's peeled
I ain't no super hero, I ain't no Marvel comic
But when it comes to game I'm atomic
At dropping it straight, point blank and untwisted
No imagination needed, cause I lived it
This ain't no fucking joke, this shit is real to me
I'm Ice-T, O.G

[Hook}

[Verse 3]
Two weeks ago I was out at the disco
Two brothers stepped up to me and said, ""Hey yo, Ice
We don't think you're down. What set ya claiming?""
E drew the Glock, yo my set's aiming!
Dumb motherfucker, try to roll on me, please!
I'm protected by a thousand emcees
And hoodlums and hustlers and bangers with jheri curls
We won't even count the girls
Cause they got my back and I got theirs too
Fight for the streets when I'm on Oprah or Donahue
They try to sweat a nigga but they just didn't figure
That my wit's as quick as a hair trigger
""He's not your everyday-type prankster.""
I'm Ice-T, the original gangster

[Hook]

[Verse 4]
So step to me if you think that you're ready to
Got on your bullet proof? Well mine's going right thru
This ain't no game to me, it's hollow fame to me
Without respect from streets, so I don't claim be
The hardest motherfucker on earth
Catch me slipping, I can't even get worked
But I don't slip that often, there's a coffin
Waiting for the brother who comes off soft when
The real fucking shit goes down, take a look around
All them pussies can be found
They talk a mean fight but fight like hoes
I'm from South Central, fool, where everything goes
Snatch you out your car so fast you'll get whiplash
Numbers on your rooftop for when the copters pass
Gangbangers don't carry no switchblades
Every kid's got a Tec 9 or a hand grenade
Thirty-seven killed last week in a crack war
Hostages tied up and shot in the liquor store
Nobody gives a fuck
""The children have to go to school!"" Well, moms, good luck!
Cause the shit's fucked up bad I use my pad and pen
And my lyrics break out mad
I try to write about fun and the good times
But the pen yanks away and explodes and destroys the rhyme
Maybe it's just cause of where I'm from
L.A. (*bang!*) that was a shotgun!

Endlessly searching for salvation

Stays at home with her mouth to the pipe

When my baby is born ""It'll look just like me""
No responsibility, the baby is born addicted
Drugged automatically the infantile life is inflicted
Extroversion has taken her control
It's given name was Jack, but it might as well be crack
Born deaf, dumb and blind, what she left behind
Is only left to die...WHY!
