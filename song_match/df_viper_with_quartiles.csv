You’ll Cowards Don’t Even Smoke Crack,"You’ll Cowards Don’t Even Smoke Crack Lyrics[Intro]
Haha
Here's a little something for you bustas
Yeah

[Chorus]
What's up with that?
You'll cowards don't even smoke crack
What's up with that?
You'll cowards don't even smoke crack

[Verse 1]
Hater, you don't even smoke crack
Bitch, you's a mark fool
Motherfuck that ho shit, pass a G that stem
I'm about to blaze up, 'specially when it's after dim
I changed the game, don't get it misunderstood
Hitting it out the glass and that smoke all good
Can't water it with green, get work, got that stick
Stars know I keep it, they on my dick, these niggas sick
But when I do smoke some green
I'm straight out that rose, you best believe
But green ain't better than that hard, hard is so much fun
Seven for forty-five, wholesale gets it done
And I don't care if you judge me
I'm smoking cooked, and living so lovely
So stop looking like you're dumb
You know you wanna try, but scared to get some

[Verse 2]
It's on and poppin'
I'm blazing white, now my destiny ain't stopping
I'm coming up in a song to rap
I sold my soul to Satan, but bought it back from God with this song
Y'all bustas ain't ballin'
Until you smoke some work and see who really paper callin'
Y'all fallin' off like the last century
No respect from me 'til you get that cheese
And you see what life is all about
'Til then, you's a judgmental bitch with a raised snout
I gets my clout from the mainstream
It's always lovey dovey in my dope scene
I'm clownin', and keepin' it rock
My coke chopped and screwed, 'cause I ball on the block
I'm stangin' big and bringin' work
All the while keepin' y'all haters feelin's hurt
[Chorus]

You'll cowards don't even smoke crack

You Wanna See Me Dead Cause Of My Hops,"You Wanna See Me Dead Cause Of My Hops Lyrics[Chorus]
My hops
They wanna see me gone 'cause of my hops
Shot in the dome 'cause of my hops
And ballin' no more 'cause of my hops
My hops
They wanna see me sprayed 'cause of my hops
And sleepin' in a grave 'cause of my hops
And not getting paid 'cause of my hops

[Verse 1]
Ballers know the deal when they see me in the place
Follow up, two-hand dunk, nuts in ya face
See, you was under the goal
Where the big boys play, so now you know
I'm 6'2"" with crazy hops
From that two-hand in my video, I'm still gettin' props
Light feet, I wear a size ten
That's why I'm gettin' up time and time again
Boys look like they wanna squab when they see me snowbird
'Cause they know they gonna get a two-hand-reverse
Or I might just do a self alley
And hang on the rim 'til your posse wanna blast me
Yeah, that's how I do
On this hoop court, I'm a fool
And I'm still getting up
To get the whole place crunk

[Verse 2]
I'm paid, I gives a fuck about a win
I'm trying to get me a nasty bam in
A loss I don't bar
I leave the court and get freaked by three stars
That's the life of a G
My hoop shorts too long to ever see a knee
White or black T-shirt, that's a bet
And I'm always dry, 'cause real ballers never sweat
Damn, a thug got game
I could've hooped in the pros, but motherfuck a plane
And boys know where I be
Marian, ballin', is where to find me
Hooping on a Thursday night
Rising to the occasion, and taking time flight
And, oh yeah, I got that thang with me
Under the bleachers you'll do a 360

[Verse 1]
I won't forget about us, I was a throwed kinda thug
But everyday, you go through my mug
It's something about you I can't shake
All the years you known me, all the cheese we made
I still call you everyday and send a text at night
One day we'll hook up again, and everything will be tight
See, these boys are jealous, 'cause the cash I stack
They want me gone from you forever, and sleepin' on my back
But that ain't gon' happen
We gon' both keep gettin' paid and I'ma keep rappin'
We have finally made it
And we can't be faded
Life is great, and I'll be thinkin' of you
And all the things we used to do
Like always holding hands when we rolled in my cars
And going camping, looking up at the stars

But I was born a thug, and that's just that

Our pockets fat, we cruisin' in that RV you wanted
Or takin' lavish trips across the world

All for lookin' for a quick come-up

Motherfucker, thought your sawed-off could split me
But I was ready when you tried to come and get me
It was real, though, you gave it a try
But I saw your bitch-ass out the corner of my eye
I saw you comin' fast in the black 'Lac
And I knew what was up, 'cause I heard that
You wanted to smoke because your ego got tapped
When you heard I called you a mark in a rap
I got you now, mark, you tried to reach somethin'
But that shit you shot really wasn't nothin'
You rolled down your windows and you throwed your plex
But what you ain't know, I was ready for what was next
When you sped round the corner
You ain't know I already had everything set up on ya
My niggas all boxed you in and put that bag over your head
So you ain't know what's happening

Makin' sure that you know I'm about to blast

Now tell me, how does it feel
To know that you's about to get killed?
And to know that you made a fatal choice
To test the G that keeps the most

And when haters see me they disappear

And it my money that make sure they leave rowdy

As I'm all cashed up, gleaned up

A G never slackin'
A hustler done got stuck on paper stackin'
Straight makin' cash, in other words
Came kickin' punks to the curb
Always pushin' somethin' nice
Always covered in ice
Draped up from head to toe
But when it gets dirty, it gots to go
Down, in my hood
I'm G'd, up hustlin', and it's all good
Shinin', in every way
Under my shirt, the three eight-
Ty the boys is trippin'
They think that they can catch me slippin'

Just hopped off the new Lex on things
My Lamborghini doors open like chicken wings
But I never touch the steering wheel of my Bentley
Cause when I ride that, my chauffeurette come get me
In my house I got thirteen maids
Seven from the motherland and six from Spain
These ladies straight take care of they thug
Massages, bath sex, showers and back rubs
What can a baller say?
Sometimes I just chill and don't leave for days
Gettin' freaked while watchin' my ninety inch flatscreen
Ring a bell, fourteen more girls are checkin' to see
If they G need huggin'
Warm touching, or old fashion fuckin'

My Maserati go hard
Indoor and outdoor court in my backyard
Every race of female I'm housin'
My pool big enough to fit one thousand
So why did I get that Navi?
So I can freak it out, like my Escalade Caddy
And add that bump
Put the box in the back and let it thump out the trunk
Appetizer puts me in an eatin' mood
My cook peepin' me out as she makes my food
But this time, I don't like the meal
She come to kiss me and say she love me still
How many cars does one G need?
I don't know and I don't care cause I got the green
Security cameras on my house, no burglar bars
Cause I keep more heat than a day on Mars

I Sell A1 Cocaine," Sell A1 Cocaine Lyrics[Chorus]
They saying I'm unique
Cause I sell the best cocaine on the streets
Ask bout me, they tell you it's A1
I sell the best coke, holla when you want some
They saying I'm unique
Cause I sell the best cocaine on the streets
Ask bout me, they tell you it's A1

[Verse 1]
I sell the best work, gone get with me
Top grade cocaine, I still sell the sticky
Powder so killer, I swear after one hit
It'll make you and your gal wanna groove it
World class powder, straight from Colombia
I put it on everything, my coke will numb ya
Certified to be tha best you ever had
Don’t forget about the horse 'cause it’s gon' keep you glad
My coke so gravy
Other dealers jealous, want me pushin’ up daisies
Cause they dope inferior to mine
Hit me up, I'mma have you on cloud nine
Link up with your thug if you ain't scary
You gon' fall in love and my cocaine you’ll marry
Unlike my competition, ain't no additive
Ice-cold, uncut, Viper, they mad at him

Whatever you buyin', I can get it to ya
My customers stay happy street's saying that I'm the realest
Dope boy that ever lived
'cause all to the dope game I give
My top rated cocaine
You hit it once and it's locked off in your brain
You'll be floating to a new plane
And we ain’t afraid to shoot, take a shot to the vein
Coward people out there, time to go home
'Cause it’s time to take a hit and go to another zone
I'm your dope man but I’ll take a hit with ya
So you see it's safe and accept the big picture
Cocaine is the movement
Judgemental cowards just scared to do it
Ain't no' these boys beat my prices
And if your money low then my price I'll slice it
Choose me while you work and relax
I sell powder, I sell crack
My work is something like you never experienced
One small sniff, on my life, you'll be feeling it
My twenty-packs lovely, have you up all day
Haters jealous of me because they know I sell the best yay
Never caught a dope case, cause I got the best goods
Customers don't snitch, cause I got the best in tha hood

One day she'll come back, but I lost her
I lost her, I lost her
One day she'll come back, but I lost her

[Verse]
I sit and wonder, how would it had been
If I would have kept my girl in my life?
But I threw it off
Tryna be the boss, blang and flossed
I got tossed like a Nina Ross
I was trippin'
Now I'm thugged out, G'd up, we clip in
Hustlin', shot-callin', not fallin', big ballin'
And I'm deep in the game
Ain't nothin' changed, it just got rearranged
I be like, ""Man...
How long can I grind?
How long can I shine?
How long will time be on my side to ride, as I glide?""
And I be like, ""Man I fucked it off
I wish I would've been more real to her, mane
But I throwed it off, now I'm just movin' in this thang""
Ridin' through, contemplating the days of my past
Waitin' to get somebody, straight ready to blast
Hustlin', tusslin', rustlin'
Never will a G be strugglin', shruggin'
Lovin' the memories of when we were huggin'

A band of plugs sound out the coil
If these boys try to get my spoil

Tryin' to catch a baller for things he sacrificed for
So I can't lay down

They lock me down, then they set it in motion
My cash is immaculate
Sit back and chill and watch how I do this
I'm the antagonist, see what I'm about
Got the protagonist scared of a joust
I intimidate boys, and get 'em on they feelings
In the meanwhile, to me, the cuties are revealin'

They're demolished with no escape path
No reprise from the force of my wrath

You died, but your memories I keep
Like how we used to battle rap on my back street
It was amazing, your freestyle was the best
You'd say shit that put other rappers' careers to rest
But last time I saw you was outside of the club
You lost the ring you was givin' to yo girl and agg' as fuck
And if I knew I wouldn't see you no more, I wouldn't believe it
That this would be the last time that I would see you breathin'
We was on the same team, with similar goals
To come up in the rap game, ball and flow
It was some fraud shit, you died too soon
Now I roll around, aggravated, starin' at the moon
Contemplatin' all the good times that we had
And if roles were reversed, I know you'd be sad
But I ain't even trippin', I'm gon' see you again
And when I do, you gone have a platinum mic in your hand

This Is How We Ride,"This Is How We Ride Lyrics[Hook: G-Money]
'Cause this is how we ride
Forever we gon' glide hollow points that slide
This is how we ride
Forever we gon' glide

[Bridge: Viper]
G-Money, what's the mothafuckin' deal?
I got my pistol, tell your thug just how you feel

[Verse: G-Money]
Now straight to the point, mothafucka
I just smoked a joint, mothafucka
That means I'm on point, mothafucka
There’s a dot on ya knot, mothafucka
It's G-Legend in your ear, mothafucka, peep peep
Got twenties on my Impala, we came to holla
Check, my bitch count run from here to Guatemala
Oh, as if you didn’t know? It’s simple
Try to block my ride until the top, yo' heart stop
Fuck gold diggers
I only fuck with mob type figures
More collar than a fuckin' pitbull
The legendary crew is top notch
Ya slip, they be collectin' ya blood in blotches
'Cause y'all hate how we're quicker than stopwatches
This ain't no fuckin' bump on the song
If you think it is, you got it all wrong
Ya funeral be full of sad song
I also smoke out of bongs
Quick to thump, if ya jump, chump
Nothin' but crown in my glass
As I flip in my mothafuckin' E-class
Oh, my ride? Consists
Of triple beams, functional screens
Special effects, TECs
I like number nine, use it
If you fuck with my shine
My modes stay in grind
It's all about the gettin' paid
I got a private pilot and a jet
To dump my distractors in the Everglades
Got hollow point slides for shady guys
See y'all rather see me on the ventilator
That's why I’m hopin' with my alligator, and my accelerator
Accelerator, most city player bred, yep, it's bread
Like fine wine, my love got shine
Rearrange your spine, nigga, I ain't got time
Love action, fuck, then erase ho's like subtraction
Why? Cause I can
Got my whole Benjamin plan
Just tell the truth, it’s kinda hard to swallow
Make you trip like Fred trip on Rollo
Hairline as Apollo, jump back in my ride
With a bitch in slides

Now I'm out here tryna find fame
I won't stop 'til Viper is a household name
So they can gold name brand me
The realest of the grind, can you stand me?
I'm tryna hit a major win
With checks going out, and mo' pourin' in
And I'ma do this 'til they brand me
So tell me will they stand me?

[Verse 1]
I done paid dues for a life time
It's been a hot minute, I been hustlin' for miles
Sittin' on the fence from comfortable to pain
Waitin' for fate to push a malla over the gate
It's like I see the prize in the distance
So my grind ain't allowin' nothing but persistence
I still parlay, don't get it twisted
But still put in work and have my people say they miss this
Cashed up shinin', stangin' on this lick
Mashin' these haters while the time ticks
They say of all time I'm the realest
My swag and my hustle gon' make sure you feel it

[Chorus]
Now I'm out here tryna find fame
I won't stop 'til Viper is a household name
So they can gold name brand me

Seems like the more folk I get, they want me to have mail
Spark the more people that want me to fail

The more that want me living, the more that want me on my back
An ever going battle of opposing forces
Constantly on the rise to collision courses
It's a question that's mind boggling to me
Why is there a thin line between love and jealousy
It's one of the things that I'll never comprehend
It's a deep one, like where does space end?

Boys gon' see how I floss
When I tap 'em cross the head with that sawed off
'Cause if you try to catch me for my stack
I'm tryna blow your head clean off of your back
I got too much to lose
So I'm quick to have your folks singin' the blues
With your face down in front of your trues
As a mark-ass busta who ain't wanna pay dues
And if they wanna retaliate
It's a hood war, nigga, and I'm throwin' the H
Plus I'm chuckin' the A
As I creep a million niggas out of nowhere, I'll put you to sleep
These boys don't wanna let plex swing
My venom's the bullets and the 4's my fangs
And my fangs get hot
Hit a hater with the venom and that heart just stops

So, it is on

I walk around with a chip on my shoulder
A lot more mature and a little older
I look at the world in a ruthless way
An aggravated killer ready to smoke you, mane
Although an optimist, I look at things differently
Eyes open, watchin' for anything
Maybe, it's because I molded myself into this
Carved into a black abyss
Now I just ride
Hopin' to blast at the drop of a dime
Watchin' boys at the corner of my dome
'Cause any second, it could be on
'Cause now shit done turned to a street war
Everywhere you go, niggas ready to pour
Yo' blood in the sewer
And leave you leakin' like a lure

Waitin' on a nigga to pray on and take under
I ain't playin' with you, this shit life
And I'm quick to take you down, and cut you up like a knife

And they get fucked up, and left delirious

Before you see a flash blink

9900 Haters On The Wall,"900 Haters On The Wall Lyrics[Chorus]
I ain't trippin' on you chumps
I don't care if you ever buy my stuff
I ain't trippin' on you chumps
I don't care if you ever buy my stuff
I ain't trippin' on you chumps
I don't care if you ever buy my stuff
I ain't trippin' on you chumps
I don't care if you ever buy my stuff

[Verse 1]
Y'all haters got me hyper
Y'all heard all my CDs on CDBaby dot com, backslash Viper
Matter fact, ten thousand of y'all heard my album
As only a hundred of y'all bought 'em
So that's ninety-nine-hundred haters on the wall
So to you, I say, (kcuf) y'all
'Cause while y'all blockin' rhyme cash like some tricks
I'm still paid, in real estate (bitch)
And that cash, you can't stop
No matter how much you hate, your mouth drops
Open, when you see the SUV
And me, with my cap back, clowning
It makes the eyes hurt
Peepin' out a thug on your way back to work
While that (mark nigga) cross the street on hate block
On his way to punch that clock
See, I'd be mad too
If God made me you

See, you boys payin' money for (ssa)
But the girls I got (kcuf) and make me cash
See, you punks don't understand what I'm stressin'
So now it's time for a lesson
I got seven companies for clientele
And seven secretaries that freak me well
Two black, two Lat', and two Asian, one white
And what's a trip is they all fine
And all mine, makin' my loot climb
And when you homos try to holla, you get denied
They answer my lines, sayin' my business names
Openin' me a quick route to fame
So I'm paid, anyway
So I don't care if you bawl or hate
Deal, my stuff's online blowin' up great
And there's a space to send an email after you listen and hate

I'm 'bout to show this mark I'm the man
And let his bitch-ass know he's dealt his last hand
This boy's lights about to get put out
And no one'll hear the shots
It's too late, mark trick, you made your choice
When you put a tone front your voice
And talked all of that bitch shit
Not knowing who you was clashin' with
Deep down, you know you's a mark
And it shows on the outside, comin' from your heart
Subconsciously, you think I'm supposed to feel sorry for ya
But you's a busta, and I won't cut for ya
Your decision was made, we in death mode
You part time, but I keeps mine locked up
Today ain't your day, your shit at home
Too bad, for you 'cause I'm bringin' it on

And it ain't playin' or an act

From the diamonds in my piece, look like a fire-starter
My brain has got my eyes on hold
I look down, all I see is shining bright gold
I hold above my eyes
To make sure my blingin' got me hypnotized
I've got em sick with my jewelry
I wonder will these boys ever feel me
Probably not, and I don't care cause all the shit I got

I might hit a stang in something new
Ducking through the hood in a Lulu
I throw this cash like it's a frisbee
It's only money, it don't mean nothing to me
My family‚ my friends got my back riding in this flapjack
I even got cash in backpacks
I'm getting cash in large stacks from every direction

But the money stacking high‚ so they can't hurt me

Got cutie-pies blushing and these haters not saying nothing
It's something 'bout it, got pretty girls on my tip
And if I told you once, then I ain't said it since
And if I did it's cause I'm grinding, cashed up
Big faced money got haters all mashed up

So they know a G is stuck on grind
They goin' in circles, can't figure out how to hurt me
Agg' after sale, it's 'cause they just can't work me
And I got these stars on my dick fo' sho'
Captivated by my lifestyle and my dough
Always in somethin' mint, car smell always new
And the way I keep my rims make you wanna smoke me too
Gear fly, neck covered in ice
But when you see my wrists, they twice as nice
Whatever it be, I drops the loot
And if you're moving too fast, I gots to shoot
I'm a baller, if you're wonderin' why
It's 'cause this here ain't no game, it's do or die
I like the way these twenties spinnin'
They doing 360s on beginning to end

I'm stuck in this game for good
Thinkin' to myself, ""I wish a nigga would
Test a killer
So I can fulfill the
Deepest portions of my dreams:
To blast on a nigga and not be seen""
Nothin' beats the game by far
I'm hittin' so many stars, it should be against the law
This lick wild, I stang all the benefits
Like cars, and clothes, and gals on my dick
And cribs, and cash, and everything
I could fall off today, in two years I'm back to paid
Parlayin' in strike mode
Watchin' for guns writing a new episode
Forget chillin'
Still ready and willin'

I ball
I always with it
Nine in the clip, but still ready for a killing
If i have to, i ain't even tripping
Use the .45 for the chest rippin
Parlayin', just cruising
Wondering who gone catch a bruisin'
Wondering why bad choices boys are choosing
And ended up losing
They lives over bullshit
Like trying to catch a G boy's grip
When they know, that shit is played out
And everything that keeps on that get hot
But fuck it, go and get shot
I'll leave you hemorrhaging, bleeding in blood clots
Head down, torn nose, hair knots
In red light, and your hand stops

Instead of walking 'round like a hoe-ass nigga
Cus you broke

Run up on me they caught me dead in they clothes
Even if you're rich, you'll still be smoked
On a table identified by your folks
And no it ain't a hoax
You'll be shotted up before your first word spoke

My piece and chain got these boys in check
I see blank faces when they see whats hangin' from my neck
And I know deep down they wanna smoke a baller
'Cause they know I'm a cash hauler
I done stanged
And got these boys sick
From what swings
And shines from underneath my dome
The brightness put you boys mind on wrong
I'm stackin' cash in places you'll never see
It's put away in places you wanna be
The beauty of my jewelry makes haters smile melt
And I'm hidden in a zone, that they never felt
I got you wishin' I was never born
'Cause the steam from my shine brings the mind home
Too bad, I'm here to stay
Increasin' these dollars everyday

Down from my mug
And makes these boys wanna put me down with a slug
But I ain't worried 'bout ya, 'cause the cash comin' in
And it's freezin' on me like a light wind
I'm ballin', these boys can't stand it
No hesitation, you'll get smoked if you demand it
These boys can't manage
It's like they callin' out for death to be granted
Its like you tired of livin'
And if you fuck with this, sleep will be given

You've been so good to me and I have been so cruel to you
I know I'm not the person you expected me to be
I still care for you, I still want a life with you
That's true, only to you can I be faithful
So I say sorry, I hope that you can understand
Can you understand? (And I say sorry)
I promise you from now I'll change
I just want you to know that I care

[Verse 2: Viper]
I'm God's favorite
Just as soon as He seen me walkin' on the pavement
I don't know why He love me so much
But He gave me His exclusive touch
He told me I'm His number one G
He told me He in love with me
He constantly asking me to hold me
""Can I hold my number one in the W-O-R-L-D?""
I come and let Him fuck with me
Just 'cause He's so crazy 'bout Lee
He straight love me, a little less than His main gal
And tell me constantly that I'm His main pal
With me, He keep it one-hunnid
Givin' me cash to be stuntin'
He said He gonna keep me made and then touched my soul
So I stay on a double G, God Gangsta stroll
He said it's only two things He want me to remember:
That's Easter, and the twenty-fifth of December
And get ready for some fun
'Cause in the end, He said He's sitting me next to His son

Yeah, I'm making them commas
Call my daddy house, send six figures to my momma
Yeah, I'm touchin' that fetti

[Verse]
I had to lay something down for my people
When it comes to mom and daddy, there's no equal
Daddy was a preacher, momma was a principal
He never spared the rod, and for that I am thankful
Church four times a week, taught me deep rooted values
Tenets of humility to this very day I use
We didn't have much, just a house and the standard shoes
But thank the Lord our clothes was new
Never had to wear 'em used
Every blue moon some might be name brand
So you was happy for whatever you can - come across
'Cause our daddy and momma - had money tight
Sometimes it brought them drama
Momma living check to check
Daddy, collection to collection
Never tripped cause none of his dreams would come to fruition
Cause he sacrificed for his sons and my sisters
To make sure we had a childhood we could remember
And respect and we could cherish
And recollect if we grew to parents
Momma had me in her thirties, Daddy had me older
Now he in his golden years, a striped up soldier
Momma made the ultimate sacrifice
Dropped out of med school so she could raise us
The way she thought was right
So she instilled in all of us to be doctors
And one actually did
My sister and her husband
The rest of us did our own thing
I got into rap and the real-estate game
My brother next to me got into movie producing
Hit some stains, now that man ain't losin'
My little sister and my brother next to my oldest
Moved they asses out, and they mental state still holdin'
My oldest sister doing good
Making money like executive assistants should
The only one I don't know bout my biggest brother Ronnie
I wish I knew where he was, I wish he'd come and find me
I heard he north of me, but I don't really know
I wanna find him so bad, it burns a hole in my soul
I wish I could write him
Last time I seen him I was a toddler in diapers
I never dreamed that we would be split apart
Now I got a big tear in the middle of my heart
Ronnie if you're listening come find out where I'm at, yo
I'm thinking bout you daily and missing you like crazy, bro
I'm telling you I love you with all of my heart
And you best believe that that love been there from the start
And cross the other side, I will see you if I don't hear
We gon' catch up and we gon' rejoice and cheer
In the platinum gates of Heaven's ghetto
And we gon' get to choose how it's gon' go
Ain't gon' be no hatin, plus a walk-through ceiling
Top choice work and plenty bad women
Plenty good drink, plenty good drugs
No court hostage, there ain't gonna be no judge
Ronnie, do you have a Facebook or Twitter, though?
Blood of my blood, flesh of my flesh, I miss you so
Therefore, before I leave this place behind me
Oldest bro, Ronnie, come and find me!

It's time to ball and cash call
Stack this cake and watch these thongs fall
Watch as my new ride crawl

[Verse 1]
These boys need intervention
As I'm ballin', cheese clownin', that's my intention
Ladies say I'm the best results of the consensus
The paper route is my climb, for instance
Breakin' up challengers is what I derive
To do competition, can't survive
I'm the epitome of ballin', you could make a sketch
[?] every frame I'm endorsing the check
These suckas agendas are faulty
'Cause they janky, fraud, and they game past salty
I just chill and continue to be a ladies' guy
But boys lose control and get thrown to the side
Of the road, check this, I'm next to none
I got diamonds shaped like a hexagon
The way they sit in, the way they mount
Is invisible, they look like they gon' fall out

My cash rises so high I don't have to interest
What flows through these boys minds is the words, ""Who is this?
Fly-ass dude, I wish I could wreck
But he come so correct I gotta give him respect""
Then what's next is their quick descent
'Til they fell out the grind residence
Cuties realize my life is rare
I don't pay a fare, yet they come out they underwear
Listen to what's been sounded
I done talked to dudes to make sure these boys grounded
It's time to clown and big ridin'
Ain't no competition, what's left is hidin'
These boys are average, at best, medium
But they stay a thug's lick 'cause they don't want none
Realizin' they only to lose, soon as retreat
'Cause they miserable established that my public can't beat

Females lovin the way I put in work
And leave these pussy niggas with they feelings hurt
With me all the ladies flirt
And leave these dudes with they emotions deserted

Where declarations to freak me are revealed
That's why I sit still
Cause the world belongs to me, so I chill

Quick blast
Shit you never saw, punks slapped in the jaw by
One real quick blast

[Verse 1: Viper]
Not a picture, but still a dome shot
Punk motherfuckers rest well from the Glock
Thugged out hustler catching boys one time
Hard lessons learned that I'm stuck on grind
Slappin' boys cross the head with a pistol
If it wasn't clear at first, then now it's crystal
Puttin' these marks in check
Got 'em more broke-up than a car wreck
I'm like an assassin
Only difference is I ain't hidin' when I'm blastin'
I'm on a gangster stroll
Boys hiding in their cribs, scared to roll
Gunshots got em duckin' all behind couches
Make 'em take off their tank tops and put on some blouses
Can't get away, might as well get around
'Cause I'm the wolf with a pump, 'bout to blow the house down

And so recognize I’m the nigga in charge

This cash is amazing (easy)
I need to recline
I roll through places
Sit and relax
Parlay and kick back
This lifestyle done got me complacent
It’s like I’m living one big vacation
As the clock spins around
I hardly look at it, that’s how I clown
As I sting on this cash mission
Watching boys fall off for making bad decisions
And ending up in life collisions
The final result? A wig splittin'
While I’m steady shinin'
Livin’ it up and unwindin'

Rap’s What I Got,"ap’s What I Got Lyrics[Verse]
Locked in the game, now it's time to do this
Roamin' through the land, like Popeye and Brutus
Ocean on fives, while my boys in the back
By the railway, second lane to the left stack
Off on a mission, to move the sound
Uptown, goin' down, blocker beats all around
Stackin' the arena, with words and phrases
While cash work around, like mice in mazes
As our tunes steal the whole room
To ride straight paid is what I live for
I wanna see you paid by the age of thirty-three
Thats [?] up, and all my homies feel me
Now we're gettin' paid in a major ass way
Exchangin' words like tradin' cards daily
We get cash to rap a G
That's all about big dog on the real
Livin', livin' like there's a mothafucka
Will I have to change?
And he's got a youngsta's brain
Tied up in a knot, a player gotta rock
In your stereo, jammin' it like 'Pac
In this ho shit, there's some people real
Tryin' to catch a G slippin' when a ballers fool
And it's fucked up, this shit's whack than a bitch
Checkin' ya dome, for a bullshit paper-ass lick
But I got control of my body
So we'll rock my shit like a beat, boy
I'mma flip through pumpin' that thang
Bumpin' to the beat, thumpin' ghetto game
I'mma keep handlin' it and lookin' up above
Flyin' through the urban beat just like a dove
Don't know where it go, shinin' bright like my steel
Down to the thugs that's keepin' it real
Playa [?] A.C.T
All them boys gon' be, that boy J-R-I-D-E
Yes, it's me, and I gotta flip it up
Ballin' through cleanly, showin' much, much love
I'm comin' thick, and I'm pumpin', and I'm bumpin' that Screw
You know how the boys in the deep South will do
Much love to them thugs at the Acres home
Much love on the North Side they got it goin' on
Anyway back to the mic, and I'mma keep on clippin' it
Keep on rippin' it, keep on hittin' it

Watchin' out for the haters, I see 'em comin'
When they move in, four pound got 'em runnin'
Laws look in my range like they wanna blast me
But then they see my ice and drive right past me
Ridin' solo, steppin' out of my ride
So much bling, as the sun hit, hustler gotta squinch his eyes
I switch rides to my six-forty-five, bass pounding
So many gals calling my cell, I can't count 'em
I answer for this star, yellow, and a Asian friend
My lifestyle got 'em buzzin' me time and time again
I'm lovin' this, it's like heaven on Earth
Sometimes I think I died and I'm there, for what it's worth
But what did mama say? Oh yeah, I reminisce
She said ""Heaven's the best, could it be better than this?""

As we start dinner off with a bottle of wine
We'll ride in my new Infiniti truck
'Cause I ain't drove it once since I bought it last month
And that club from earlier that you speak
We can't go there, I did a show there last week
And the girls over there wanna get with me

Just follow me and the light streams from my diamonds
We'll chill in VIP and keep my shit on the low

Oh, you wanna try Hpnotiq?
Yeah, it tastes good, I don't think that you'll knock it
But if you do, I'll get some Pérignon

It's cold, the way I destroy these males
My paper grind is exclusive and unique
And my grind shine is shiny and sleek
Never lost a battle givin' boys defeat they need
They leave the battle disrespected in defeat
To the pretty girls I'm their only
Priority that they carry
They take care of me as I sit back and recline

Of me in private, and you know what's gon' happen
I'm livin' a dream, as my pockets fatten
And that's why every woman's passion is to be in my life
My cash climb is fast
Meanwhile I keep these males livin' in the past
Peep play, I make boys never neglect

Me losing is something I can't fathom
I'm winning stangs that men can't imagine
These chumps' grind game is not proficient
And they cash licks are insufficient
To keep 'em from hitting rock bottom
And me laughing 'bout it, saying I got 'em

Cause if they do, they'd know I'd be they truth plug
But I ain't tripping if they don't fuck with me
That's why I'm screaming, pussy niggas, come get me!

My cake bake game is enormous
The girls fall in love with me cause of my performance
In the bed where intimate time spent
Big cake in my pockets my boys will still relent
Catch me clownin, inside or outside
Hotties always with me and keep me feeling alive
All the while I'm mashing on these dudes
Showin' no mercy for them, and treatin' them rude
I'm living life without a care
Meanwhile these other males saying life ain't fair
Not only me but all the girls too, are inconsiderate
Of these dudes 'cause they cash game don't hit
But they love me and what I stand for
Got every girl in the world knocking at my front door
And I'm cash filled so I'm left with ample
Time to give every lady a sample
Of me

All the girls love the fact that I'm made and paid
To keep all these lames in their turned up graves
It's a trip, I can't stop stacking bills
And plus the fact that I'm real keeps chicks giving me thrills
These men are jokes, I get in they hair with sarcasm
I'm winning all the babes and all the stacks, I got to have 'em
Time and my grind, honey, dips reserved
Though I'm a busy man, they get the love they deserve
My shine goes so hard in the bank
I'm big ballin' and these boys ain't
They'll do what it take to get me, they stay persistent
Meanwhile these boys heart rates are inconsistent
The models say ""I wanna get with ya""
I'm living proof these fools go to the victor, I'm livin' proof

The day you left and we broke up
People asked me what's going down
And I tell them you don't feel me now
They say I ain't tryin' hard enough
When I tell them that your stance is tough
They say I need to buy you things
And I say ""That ain't working no more, mane""
Then they say ""What am I sayin'?""
And I tell them, one time in life I been wastin'
I wanna hold her tight in my arms
Hold her tighter than my full python
Or my [?] the boa
The whole world will know how much I love her
More than anything
When you're ready, I'll be waiting in the game

When I was in your world, and you was lovin' mine

Now I'm thugged out ridin' with my Nina Ross
Whenever unexpected I call
I get the voicemail, and that's all
And when I see other couples chillin'
I'm wishin' it was us, but I know I'm just dealin'
But still, I really miss
The way you look in my eyes when you give me a kiss
You'd let me know everything was alright
You pull up on me and hold me tight

Truth is revealed, I ball
Cake, jewelery, cars, dude, I got it all
I stand tall, as I walk
Diamonds on my neck, got boys on no talk
I'm loving the way I'm making this cake
All the cash I'm seeing from the decisions I make
I done set myself up for continual cash
G's up, marks down, as I hide my stash
Keeping dude on retreat, that's how I'm doing them
They can't get away, bankruptcy pursuing them
Every plan they done had
To come up in this game, I done trashed
These haters, I done locked
Out this game that I only rock
In this hustle of infamy

Sometimes I don't know what to do with the cheese
But then I just go and buy a new load
You like my '06 'Vette on twenty-fours?
That's a good way to knock off sixty
Now all my G's making cheese, can yous feel me?

Locked off in this hustler's game
Some boys hate to see me ballin'
Top down, G'd up, major shot callin'
But that's the way it goes
Every dog has his day, and mine is every day, dog
I'm making cash like I gots to, mane
It stays in my life like rails under a train
And if I ever went broke, I'd make a bank transfer
And be richer than the Pope

My green game is incalculable
Daily I can't add it up, my time is too valuable
I mash on these boys, with merciless precision
They don't stand a chance, it's shown by their mannerisms
I dominate competition from the start
They see total annihilation because they got no art
To these dudes I ain't polite
Let these bustas see, that this is real life
My stangs are so unique

But sometimes, it gives me an attitude like I don't care
And yeah, I'm still hangin', and life is fair
And while I'm still waitin', I'm havin' things

Just be content, 'til you're ready for me

In The Hood,"n The Hood Lyrics[Chorus: Ice LaBell]
In the hood
There's no other place for me
In the hood
There's no place I'd rather be

[Verse 1: Viper]
Ghetto rules are hard to understand
It's tough to survive if you don't know a man
Thug deep, ballin' through the urban sands
Ridin' solo, wheels at my command
It seems that ghetto dreams
Are deep in my mind as they just beam
I can see 'em in the distance like a light
Making me do the thangs that I do, it's alright
Stars down, ready for the sparkin'
Playa' on the scene, and you know I'm ghetto walkin'
I'm stompin', falling through a ghetto lock-in
Run up on my Glock, and you know it's ghetto talkin'
All my homeboys, yeah they showin' much love
Like it's comin' down, from above
So I keep on pressin' with these ghetto dreams
Ghetto beams, and ghetto things

I'm flippin', and I'm fallin, and I'm kickin' so real
Everythang is chill, lick reveal
It's amazing, matt'a fact, baller made
As I kick back, doin' this thang every day
But it's called... it's called R-A-P-P-I-N-G
And all my boys feel me
I ride with G's that I grew up with
And I ain't even trippin', it's a major lick
Them boys are all about they paper, and all about they cash
Movin' thangs quick, and movin' thangs fast
In this concrete jungle, as we're bumpin' these woofers
In six by nines, with the eight on this alpine
Greater, later, left/right, faders
System heard for miles, and you know we ain't no haters
We stackin' paper every day
Ballin', shot-callin', and gettin' our way

Planted in my head while I'm doin' a task
Thinkin' to myself, as the tape rewinds
""A playa' gotta stay deep on his grind""
I'm scoopin' up, one of them G's
We' bout to head downtown for a meetin' in the industry
The game of fame, and everythang is so legit
In this thing, we ain't gon' neva' quit
My boy told me once ""parlay and just play""
In this thang that's real, for us to be made
I dwell amongst tall buildings, a city slicker
Keepin' it cool, so I'm blowin' up quicker
I'm chillin' like that boy said to do
Keepin' it cool, movin' with the ghetto rules
And understand the ghetto wells
The ghetto rules, and the ghetto tales

[Verse 1]
In this mackin' game, I'm too cold
The way I'm winnin' all these stars got my head swole
From these dimes, I get pulled
These gals strangers to each other and they got my car full
I'm on a new plateau
With so many gals around me, some I don't even know
Thirty-six gals, six the last year in senior high
Ten black, ten Asian, eight Lat', eight white
When I pick 'em up from school, they look good what they wearin'
They hop in my car, while stupid niggas starin'
I'm comin' up fast
Lockin' up these models, with all this cash
Man, my life potent
My win game off the chain, I keep an unreal quotient
And you blockers can't make it cease
It'll never go down, only increase

Sometimes they just post me up
Lock me down in my spot, so I can't get up
But when we go out, it's whatever they want to do
Movies, fine cuisine, sometimes, the two
Find they asses no boundaries
It's like they my bodyguards, the way they surround me
And they start textin' me when I have 'em home
They hit me so much, shit gets stuck in my phone
'Cause where we go it's whenever
Rain, sleet, snow, it don't matter the weather
And sometimes when it's dark
They take me to go parlay at the park
Folks see it and they wonder what's goin' on
Then they see it's me, and they just move on
That's everyday in my life
Nothin' goin' wrong, everything goin' right

You fellas can't hang with me

[Verse 1: Viper]
Where the ladies at? Ridin' two hoes
I pull up to the club, I hear a truck pumpin' throat
I hear it as I pull, in the lot of the spot
Thought it was a head, but it was not
When I pump, the bass, shook my rear view
I was drippin', she was makin' a bass monsoon
I hop out my vehicle, and look in her eyes
Two seconds in, more like five
Hours, 'bout to fall in the scene
Peepin' out my '04 Expedition, shiny clean
Ladies, where ya at?
Makin money, lettin' assets stack
Buildin' empires, female sires
Burnin' corporate structures, higher and fire
That's real, get paid, while I rise
And if it's rainin', catch me out the sky

As I step in the club, yeah, I see her, there she go
The same female that was bumpin' in that low
If she knew the way she looks back
If she gets close, time to react
I make her walk around, and sit a bit away
Last night I drank beer, so it's liquor today
I'm parlayin', passin' here to catch a clown
While chillin', listenin' to the club sound
I see her from afar, we glance at a distance
I play it cool, 'cause I'm never persistent
Then she gets up, and makes a loop around
Then she sits about six-feet down
From a balla, I ask about her system she says, ""Amplify""
How could a girl that fire, have such a tight ride?
She said I was cute, plus I'm rich, so it's on
Where the ladies at? Rollin' with chrome

Thug is a definition that I got in my mind

Back of the club, mugs keep hoppin'
So trill, keepin the baller crunk

And you grind it, please rewind it

[Verse 2]
Damn baby girl, body off the chain
You a work of art that's stuck in my brain
I'm like ""Man, this girl is fine
I gotta put her down as a girl of mine""
I'm inclined to throw up my weight
The fact that I'm winnin' in this paper chase
But she ain't even trippin' on the cash I'm foldin'
This girl don't have no ulterior motives!
She just ballin' for me 'cause I'm grindin'
Though she probably do like the way these diamonds shinin'
Rainbow colors, blue, green, yellow, red
Flashin' through her mind, and goin' through her head
It's somethin' 'bout the way she looks in my eyes
She ain't 'fraid to stare, and with me, that's alright
Never had a boyfriend, just turned nineteen
She want me to be the one to turn her on to the scene

Yeah, baby, you're lookin' real good
I'm lovin' the fact that I went through the hood
And you was wearin' a miniskirt
Lookin' so fine, I had to flirt
I was like ""Yeah, what's up, baby girl?
When I saw you, I had to make a U-turn, girl
That body was slammin'
Remindin' me of when I was in college, crammin'
Tryin' to hurry up, so I can go out and play
With a girl like you,"" that talk made her day
That's how I feel
Let's ride out, in the sunset, for real
Just me and you
It'd be so much fun, you wouldn't know what to do
'Cause a light set it off

My cash game is endless
I only chill with girls not dudes so I'm friendless
My green game is incalculable
Daily I can't add it up, my time is too valuable
I mash on these boys, with merciless precision
They don't stand a chance, it's shown by their mannerisms
I dominate competition from the start
They see total annihilation 'cause they got no heart
To these dudes I ain't polite
Let these bustas see, that this is real life
My stangs are so unique
They got all the ladies lovin' my techniques
Forever blood 5-9 Piru
Cocaine empire highway clique
What they gon' do
Nothin
But watch me ball
And plot on my life as my new ride crawl

Cutie pies say my shine grind is so impressive
That's why with me all the girls are so protective
I'm making sure these dudes have a bad temper
I keep em on they feelings as they minds I enter
I'm not letting boys be cool I'm keepin' em mean
That helps em understand why they're fallin' off the scene
My cash stack is so high and increasin' steady
It's got me chillin' and relaxin' as i get more fetti
To these fellas, I'm causin' harm
I'm the coolest in the world like when I was in prison forms
The gorgeous girls, hearts I prevail
And with, only me they bail
They know the realest nigga when they see it
It's me
And you can't be it

Models knock me off then they smash rewinding
That means they rewind the action the next day
And let me hit the same way
Or if I want, they let me change it up
And let me knock 'em down any way that I want
This cash got these stars goin' crazy
But the way I got 'em don't even amaze me
I done got paid, bad chicks on my jimmy
Now, all they bodies, they all give me
My diamonds blang as I mall by my cheese
While these haters thinkin' they can be like me, I'm sayin' ""Please""
And they tryin' everything to keep me from my green
They even threw me in the penitentiary
But it ain't work, and I ain't goin' back
And now I'm locked in on unendin' cash
Now I'm makin' major bread, free or incarcerated
They can't stop my money flow, and now these shina haters hatin'
Everyday a new spot, everyday a bad chick
Everyday new bread, protected by a goon clique
Cutthroat thugs that'll put you to sleep
Just for thinkin' bout testin' V
Cause a lot of marks hate instead of keepin' it G

My piece and chain shines everywhere
Even in my dreams, I'm locked in a shine stare
I'm made in real life and made in my sleep
It's like I can't get away from my money
In reality, I got cars and houses
And a gang of bad gals that pull up they blouses
I got so much cash, clothes, and jewelry
That I could give my piece and haters still wouldn't feel me
I got so much money, it's almost like I stole somethin'
While snitches poppin' cheap champagne bottles, frontin'
I'm on another level
Foes wanna catch me for my Byzantine and my bezel
The dividends I make
Got me givin' high stakes
It's like I got eyes in the back of my head
For these clowns that wanna end up dead
For tryna get me for my bread
Did you hear what I said?
I don't care if you're hungry or fed
Try to snatch my chain, I'ma fill you with lead
I got too much value
To lose my life to man one of you
Cause it done got too good

I go deranged if haters plug my name
You gon' be dead if you look here for a quick stang
I got top money on maintain
Meanwhile haters going insane

And if you wanna test the grind, then state your claim

And haters are mad cause I'm second to none (Cause I got it made)
It's a trip how haters be hatin'

I’m mad on these cowards, I don’t treat them fairly

Maintain they own life
So they know they can’t handle me in a battle fight
After tha war, I recollect on the bout
And recount the mortal blows that I dished out

How the fuck this punk get blessed?
Need to put his ass to the test
How the fuck this punk get blessed?
Need to put the nine down his chest

[Verse 1]
Time to go off on some of these rappers, mane
How the fuck these faggots gettin' blessed in the game?
I wonder how they keep gettin' major record deals
Bitch soundin' bustas with no rap skills
Probably 'cause they sucked another rapper dick to get paid
Walkin' with a limp, lettin' another nigga gettin' laid
Anyone tryin' to start his own label
When they steal a horse in somebody else stable
These bitch niggas trip me out
Wonder should I put a nine or a dick in they mouth?
The way they dick ridin' other mothafuckas
The nigga probably pimpin' that ass undercover
You know it ain't punk [?elected?]
And if you get close, get yo' wig split
I'm 'bout to make a flawless bet
In hoops, you was prolly called the teacher's pet
These wack rappers got me upset
And if you run up, you gone get wet

Cain Game,"ain Game Lyrics[Intro]
Crack is cocaine that has been mixed with water and baking soda and heated into a crystalline form of cocaine. What people do is take the crack, put it on the end of a small pipe, and then they heat the end of the pipe and inhale the vapors. That allows the cocaine to enter into the bloodstream and the brain within eight seconds

[Chorus]
I did it for the cocaine, I did it for the cocaine
I did it for the dope game, I did it for the dope game
Did it, I did it, I did it for the cocaine
Did it, I did it, I did it for the dope game

[Verse 1]
I did it for the cocaine, I did it for the cocaine
Ain't nothing changed but the size of the piece and chain
And these haters got more lame
Cause they out here snitching out folks' names
But you know I'ma always keep that work
You need something? Hit me up on text alert
I'm cooking chicken while these cowards wanna cook meat
I'm cooking bread while these haters eatin' chicken feed
I got what you need but don't ask me why
I keep the hard and the soft, never on standby
And I always stay fly
I'm burning through cash like E-F-F-I-G-Y

[Chorus]
I did it for the cocaine, I did it for the dope game
My money so smart it's like it's got a brain
I maintain my street hustle
And now I'm getting paid without the slightest struggle
I did it for the cocaine, I did it for the cocaine
I did it for the dope game, I did it for the dope game
Alright! This is crack, and this is what you smoke it in
I've heard of that stuff
Now you get to try it

And my money keep the pretty girls starstruck

I'mma show you how a thug really feel
Like my wrist flick game, my money got thick
I got that pineapple, holla if you want a lick

And they mad at me, cuz I'm vaporwaved up

Nobody but us, we ain't takin' no friends

And that superstar face
Got a nigga feelin' that he high in space
Why don't we just roll to the beach
So I can see you out them jeans, in a bikini?
Or we can go play laser tag
So I can see that round shake when it's movin' fast
Or we can go play putt-putt golf

You lookin' real sexy sittin' on my couch
Watchin' the new DVD
Laying back chillin', watchin' my big screen
I look over, and you smile once more
Should I go and shoot now, or at the end of the show?
Right now, forget it, I ain't waitin'
So I whisper in your ear, sweet nothin's I'm sayin'
I push a button and the couch recline
Not quite flatbed, but bed at decline
We sittin' up about 60 degrees
You feelin' that real thug love from a G

As you lean over too to make sure I don't miss
I hit the button again, now it's straight 45
You get on top of me, while I look in them eyes

See I'm chillin, with gals on my dick

And I'm still gone get this cash
So as far as I'm concerned, you can kiss my ass

But I'm the peoples fav, and you kept it true
So we can run and ball our gats while i'm slangin bills
We goin ballin hustlin thats a lifestyle that malls
We didn't ball, we just shot called

Hoop court tonight and it's on, son

Aw yeah, I just got me one
Hanging on the rim til' these pussy niggas want some
Man, I'm lovin dis here
That's why I be hoopin' every day of the year!

Deep In Tha Hustle,"eep In Tha Hustle Lyrics[Hook]
Deep in the hustle, deep in the tussle
More than the shine, deep in the struggle
Deep in the hustle, deep in the tussle
More than the climb, deep in the struggle
Deep in the hustle, deep in the tussle
More than the shine, deep in the struggle
Haters keep frontin', saying that they chill-
How could they be chill when they snitchin' on the real?

[Verse]
Jealous of my shine, cause they see me riding, 20-20
Knew I was a thug when they seen mе hold plenty
Money, cause I'm on
Yеah that was me, cruisin it on chrome
Cliques were mad when they see the chainpiece
And it wasn't just one chain, it was three!
Plus, you know me but your crew is phony
It hurt a thug when they said I ain't they homie
Got so much to say, but I'm a man of few words
Catch me on the ground, flying a bird
Cash ain't nothing, so find me stuntin
In a whip filled with all new hunnids
I'm taking this here stang by storm
Enemies envious, so they ringing they alarm
My time yet ain't come
But when it do, I promise I'm gone stunt
Big face, green nose got me feelin like a top man
With haters sick from the game plan
And now I'm on-
One hundred stacks from above and on my phone
Word on the streets, they want me on my back
Prolly cause I got a lot of muscles and a sixpack
But I ain't goin out like that
Catch me VIP with 50 stacks
I'm keeping haters broke and wack
And I wouldn't have did it if they were cooler than that
So I'm back at it
Living in places with pools in the back
And goons all around me that don't show no tact
So don't come up testing, or you might get slapped
Cash, that's what I feel
Now, everybody know that I'm chill
Hah, can't test a figure
When everybody sayin I'm that nigga
And, my thugs might peel ya
If you come sideways, thinking you a killer
I'm out here paid
Never work a day, I'm loungin out in the shade
While haters gettin played
Agg' at a shiner, mad cause I'm made

And now we infiltrate puttin y'all on fall

Now I'm retired in this thing, rich as a bitch, mane
While you boys workin' J.O.B's
I'm out here every day vacationing
Balling, is all I do
Catch me on the whole court, acting a fool
Dunkin' on your homies - two hand hangas
Goons always with me, so don't test or it's danger
Totin' a red flag, and still gots homies that's blue
The way I'm winnin' thinking U.S.A, I love you
Airin' down the mall, buying everything in that bitch
You've got me sayin', is Heaven better than this?

Step in the club, piece and chain bling
Niggas like damn, he must be an athlete
They partially right, I'm a baller it shows
But you know the best hoopers don't play in the pros
You seen my hoop videos, you seen me clownin'
Still got 20 more years till I hit my prime
6' feet 2"", hops like I'm 6'9""
One of many reasons why boys want my shine
I sleep all day, in the club all night
Money everywhere mane, this is the life
Buyin up the bar, mane I'm acting a fool
All the bad bitches choosin' up on me and my dudes
I'm rich and not famous, but boys is hard to hate
These pussies don't know what I got on my plate
But if you look under the table you gon' see that too
And me and my G's gon' turn this place up a tune
[Chorus]
I'm so made, I'm so made
I don't know what to do, I don't know what to do

[Verse 1]
I'm on a level never felt
Peep the cards that I've been dealt
The heavyweight belt of rap is mine
The realest G in this cash climb
You might see me ridin' by clean
As I glide in that new '13
From these boys I'm seein' frustration
Mad at the world for they present situation
I'm just a hustla and a deep banga
Trickin' on these haters cause they filled with anger
Ever since I got out the penitentiary
I had this attitude that you can't fuck with me
It's like I got a chip on my shoulder
'Cause they took some years from me as a baller got older
But I ain't trippin' on that no mo'
They done let a G loose, now I'm runnin' the show
You think that you know me, but you probably don't
Never did, and probably won't
Boys motives are questionable
It's like they all in a hurry to get pulled
Anyway I want it is how my money's spent
Meanwhile, cuties give themselves to me as a present
Boys are fallin' off like a nine to five
Taking a whole lifetime, and never realize

Mad at a G, 'cause I'm stackin' this paper
I'm locked on this hustle like a train on rails
And with this mission, there's no way I can fail
'Cause this is real life
Run up to stunt and you can die
I'm deep in the cut
With so much money in the bank, I think it might blow up
Catch me mallin' with somethin' new
Or on that whole court dunkin' on dudes
But wherever I'm at, you know I'm with somethin' bad
Keepin' models so cold, boys wanna blast
The only thing on this earth that's as real as me, mane

I'm just out here, ridin' in
Check out the way my cash spent
Price tags are just paper
I buy it now so a hater can't later, nope
The money is all I know
I can trust it, unlike a friend or foe
Can't trust em, so here I go
Gettin' to money like dogs into cats, tho
Huh, and haters gone hate
As long as there's oxygen for them to take
For real, and they gon' stay fake
Try to eat it, and keep it if you give 'em cake
One reason why haters lives ain't great
Meanwhile, I'm out here living first-rate
For real, with more on my plate
Running through money, always in first place

Trying to figure out how to get me upstaged
What in this game of dissing
But I'm showing out on the competition
Bad acting; the cash is the mission
Meanwhile haters wishing my wig was splitting
Pow, blood out on the pavement
Hits so hard that money can't save it
Naw, but that can't happen

Cut off my haters face and put it in my gumbo
I'll pincushion a hater with that voodoo
Hit em with that hex like ""Who knew?""

Life comes in different norms
When a throat gets cut back
The bleeding essence is an aphrodisiac
Hands and feet in a lunchbox
Wrapped in plastic, there's no smell, cause it don't rot
And faces mummified for eternity
It's like a horror ride, come and see

It's coming so easy
Cause the whole world need me

[Verse 1]
I make haters' dreams expire
Everyday my money climbs higher and higher
I'm the realest of the stang, that's official
One reason girls give it up on the initial meeting
They cut for my style and cash
They was a trip, they all bad, fine and classy
In bed they tuck me
I got all the ladies so I always feel lucky
These funds that I make got these snitches going mental
I'm all cash purchases, they leases and rentals
All the bad girls call me a boy that's pretty
That's the main reason why marks wanna kill me
What lies so deep is they hate
Cause I'm so cool I changed the way the world rotate
I got the win on lock
And that there somethin that they won't stop

Haters agg' 'cause of the stars I bring on the block
Ever seen a redhead on her knees?
Double that nigga, and you talking 'bout Lee

Two gals on my dick means killa ass foreplay
I remember when I hit my first Indian meat
Smashed that pussy like a dog in a heat
I'm cold when it comes to these hoes
I'm tryna knock that ass off like my Rover on fours
I never get head for less than an hour
Catch me in my Jacuzzi with four dimes in my shower
The [?] three captivates the mind
Follow up by the twenties and they hypnotized
Then I reel 'em in with the bling
I'm blazin' more hits than a boxing ring

One by the laptop and one by the phone
Just in case I gotta leave quick
Two knots in the spot won't let me forget
But if I do, it's two in my sweatpants
And jackers that's hatin' don't stand a chance

And though it's just a .38, the bullets unique
Hollow points have you lookin' funny

Due east on my way to Chicago
As I'm ballin' I fall through Milwaukee
To pick up some beer, talkin' on my walkie talkie

I'm lookin towards pistol play
I might have to take a life today
Cause if these boys go to trippin'
Imma have to catch a hater slippin'
I'm lookin towards pistol play
I might have to take a life today
Cause if these boys go to trippin'
Imma have to catch a hater slippin'

[Verse 1]
Marks talk behind my back, spittin' all that hoe game
Imma let them know, what's my damn name
Think it's a game? What your clique gon find?
Peace of mind, when your boys die
Imma put this issue in your life
If you thinkin' flex, you better think twice
It's bout time to put the clip in
Just in case these haters get to trippin'
Imma let thеse busta's know
Run ya pussy ass up, and you gon' get smoked
Onе swipe, take your mug off your body
And leave your remains at your snitch made house party
Nothin' new, peep how I feel
Jealous cowards learn that it's real
Touch it with that four, watch it hit that coffin
Then back door, when that new thang flossin'
So bruh go and get your gun
First to the pistol, let's see how it's done
Either it's me or it's you
But I'mma tell ya now, when I see ya I ain't talkin', I'mma shoot

I'm gon show y'all boys how to cook dope
You scared to drop an eighth, so y'all only drop four
Only use the pyrex, you scared of the cake pan
It's got a G trippin' though, how you boys whip man!
Then you wonder, why you ain't bring nothin' back
Cause you dropped too much water, and lost all that
Don't even test your work, then you get your feelings hurt
When your customers snitch you out, cause you sold them dirt
How the fuck you think I never caught a dope case?
Cause I always make sure I got the best base
I'm never coward to give my batches a taste
Before I buy a zone, I'mma snort and make sure it's straight
I sell the best crack, cause I don't buy stepped on dope
Guaranteed A1 before it even hit the floor
Cause the original is always better than that copy
So I'm holdin' pineapple and you holdin' on sloppy

Everything is chill, I'm acting ever ill
I'm deep in the game as a nigga just rearrange
Things and change, and it's never lame
See I'm running through the hood, jumpin' over the fence
Cause I'm about to get paid and somebody wanna kill this
Lyricist, gals runnin' after me, but I ain't trippin'
I don't follow purpose so they can't catch me slippin'
That's why I'm never hatin', hard from the duplicating
Still riding on daytons, jumped out the proclamation of
Paper that I wanna see, the industry
Opened up by real ballers and G's
Who came up on the real rap game
Playas who established, and thug life made

The life, every month, I'm informed
Of new interest earned on my cash, that gives boys harm
All my challengers are defeated there are no exceptions
To live out the duel, they must ask for permission
I intimidate boys hearts and minds
And help them, to disappear in a short time (marks)
I'm so flamboyant, money bought my happiness look how I'm glowin'
Cake holdin' is my theme
Look how it's got these men, fallin' off the scene
I'm a real life gangsta so I'll never die
As these models say it's me, that occupy
They minds, only with me they loose
And they give me they all, as I reduce
These fellows to nothing, I'm shinin' and clownin'
These boys know my name even though I keep em frownin'

You can find me winnin' on that gangsta glide

This onslaught I put on boys proves to be too much (snitch)

Players givin' invites to come ballin' hoop
I show love back, stayin' forever true
That's what’s going down, that’s whats up though
While these boys steady happy with the .44
It's fucked up though, when it go down I'm strapped
Fuck these bitch ass niggas, yeah, I got my pack
I keep my eyes open, ready for the floss
Pop pop pop, watch as them bullets go across

Making big money deep in the dope game

Grindin', surviving in his own way
One day, you actin' with real [?]
I wish you the best, I hope you transpire
While some boys knock a hustle
Standin' tall, still I ball, locked in the struggle
I'ma hold it down 'til the day you reunite
But if we never do, I know we'll still be tight

[Verse 1]
Niggas like to front like they hard (evoL)
'Til a baller catch 'em slippin' and pull that trigg-ah
'Cause when boys see the Bentley
Somethin' in they mind make 'em wonder if they can get me
But they learned a hard lesson
That my four will leave you dried up like turkey and dressing
And it ain't no second guessin'
When the Glocks start pressin', bitch boys are stressin'
'Cause plex with Vipe is suicide (evoL)
So ask yourself, is it worth having to die?
A lot of these boys ain't makin' no sense
Thinkin' life's a free ride off another nigga licks
But if that's the way you wanna look at it
I really don't care, I'ma just let 'em have it
And let the shotgun talk
And let it shoot at ya 'bout how you got caught

Let me know, tell me what you wanna see (evoL)
I got an idea, you wanna see if I'm a G?
Now you know, bitch nigga, gunshot to your chest
Turned your whole body frame to a bloody mess
Chest spread out, kinda like my cheddar
Got your clique looking like y'all went through a paper shredder
It'd be better to ride out with the win
'Cause once I start blastin' I will not resent
My decision to blow your head off of your body (evoL)
And burn out without a trace, and pick up a hottie
I'm a bull and I won't die
No time soon, I'm too quick and too fly
'Cause I grind and shine fo' sho'
But it'll be my .45 that'll let these boys know
I'll do your redrum and won't think about you
Peeps won't find you, no drama, I'll do without it

All the ladies fall in love with me, 'cause I got that money and that energy
Check out the grind, of a cash winner
In war I crush comp and leave 'em having a fit
Then they see and realize they can't beat me then they split
Every day my daily activities be poppin'
'Cause my money got me left with unlimited options
With me, the models act banished
And the hustlas that I got keep my enemies famished
I ain't never lost a contention if I ain't told ya
And cutie pies keep me posted up in enclosures
I position in the broads, and to me they yield
Throwin untamed respect to the realest in the field
Undisputed in all contests, and I remain
The number one shiner of the game

Refusin to let em shine, not even a little
I'm the one and only, the commodity that escapes
And if I'm challenged to a duel, best believe I'm there
Chumps are jealous of my shine with me they're made to fall out
While stacks I keep getting so they know what I'm about
In the fight, I leave combatants incoherent
Mama said not to test I get on 'em like they swearin
I win every match by blowout,  no need to score it
My specs are powerful enough to knock the moon off orbit
Big cash is known by me, and for defeat from me, there's no remedy
Big cribs, cash and cars is all I keep in my world

Potential licks, I evaluate
If you talking pretty girls I hold the most weight
I make my competitors tremble in fear
Show em they'll never compare and then get em out of there
I'm such a calm and collected individual
That win so big, it's critical
For these boys to understand they can't get with me
I'm too talented and skilled and they can't compete
I'm clownin' too hard, and that's a bet
Men wanna throw me off and catch me up like a net
But I'm too smart, and self contained
To get myself caught up in the game
I ball, and fall thru clean
Boys want my life cause how my diamonds gleam
But I won't let it it happen, I'mma keep rappin'
Hittin major licks as boys keep dirt nappin'

Before challengers hit the square I make them hearless
I'm running circles round boys like Jupiter
As cutie pies call me and say 'we scoopin ya'
Up to freak it down so get ready to have it
That's the lifestyle I live, straight up lavish
You boys ain't even had, your first three way
While I'm foursomes and fivesomes every other day

Have you ever seen a G
Who was literally a G-E-N-I-U-S?
Yes that's me, a double G
Have you ever seen a G
Who scored top 99 percent on the SAT?
Who was accepted to every Ivy League university?
Yes, I'm a double G

[Verse 1]
All the cutie pies say I'm exactly what they need
But they see what I'm stacking constantly
Blameless and [?]ness is what these dudes project
Two of the reasons why I'm keeping them in check
The choice to ball I make while these dudes are indecisive
To the girls my shine is top choice and so inciting
I got these haters scared of the task
Of coming up on a dealer cause they'll see that flash
I'm the classed cause I keep my licks
I'm playing pick up cash while they playing pick up sticks
I'm the hustle's top baller, that's simple and plain
All the while I'm making sure competitors don't see a game
To compete against me, none qualified
But I'm real, so I still give em a try

Out, eat my stacks
You can see by my snaps I go hard in the paint
Haters might say that they can beat me but they know that they can't
I send them away, asking themselves the question
Why did I even try flexing
With that boy, when I know he got the most style
And he's the top of the grind and all the while
They already knew they was making a mistake
Stepping up to the ruler of cake

But if they react to their feelings, they'll regret it
And get they bitch ass wetted

Wanting to snitch on my 'caine sales
And see me with no bail
But my moves too quick
To get caught up behind these state cliques
So I just roll with my crew
Real Gs, who know just what to do
With a hater
Bust they head now, and bust they head later
Now my cash is major
Left and right money, just like a fader
This cash make me a top player
And to my ego it cater

While keeping how they wanna break me off

[Verse 2]
I sling all the guns, .40 at a nigga
But they scared to pull the trigger
'Cause they know I represent some real shit
And I'm a G that they don't wanna fuck with
Ain't no [?], watch these diamonds as they bling
I'm gonna let these bustas know who a killer be
It's time for my four
I'm about to let it go, as if it would show
And tell somebody
That's it's time for this hollow point party
As I continue
To sting what's next on the venue

Peep out the hustle man, watch how I ball
Lot of bitch niggas wanna try to see if they can stall
The top choice malla out the Southwest
But I'mma be the one to put these marks to the test
They can't fade me, I'm too real
Pussy boys, just chill or get yourself killed
This ain't no motherfuckin' game
I'll shoot you in your head before you can flex about fame
I'mma show these boys what the dirty south is all about
When I bust your homie with that pistol all in his mouth
I tried to tell you that your clique was hoes
You should've joined my crew, but you wanted to be a bitch though
So now I'm gon' make you pay
Watch out for that motherfuckin' AK spray
Bitch nigga
I told you I was in the game, real talk
I don't just spit the words, I walk the walk
Check my swag, nigga you gon' see it's one-hundred percent
And the cash I got, can't be spendin'
I got too much, I just throw it up
Like when I throw that deuce in your face, chump
You beef with me, you goin' up in a hole, punk
I put that on my set, homeboy, what's up?

And cheers we got and sometimes I wish they would fall
But I'm the realest
Niggas better feel this
Or I'mma hurt one of you marks
And show you that a blood thug really got heart
I grew up in that hard part of Texas
Where boys don't bar no flexes
All we do is bust caps
And put mark-made snitch dudes on they backs
Real talk, you'll get put to sleep
For tryna get what's in my SUV

Money, coming in from everywhere
Got me feelin' like something equal to a millionaire
It's like it's pourin' out the air
It's got me thinking, should life be this fair?
Money, coming in from everywhere
Got me feelin' like something equal to a millionaire

[Verse 1]
My cash makes these haters have manners
And take the title as they bawl off planners
These marks' plans never go forth
I laugh about it, while I rake up my starred decisions
I make to break cops, they undisclosed
And they attempts in battle, have been disposed
When I'm offered in of there's, no escape
I eradicate them, and don't let them mate
Eh, in this hustle
They knew off the top that they swag had no muscle
I even decimate click, no prisoners, just casualties
Leaving entire teams is nothing but catastrophes
My life is so plus, or shall I say, so great
There's only 7 days in the week I wish it was 8
These snitches can't approach, they stay still
While I intimidate, always in motion

While rappers are wearing, piece and chain shaped square
The way I mall, dang discreet
I buy things that are unique, and shine every week
Enemies wanna finish me, but I won't have it
They offence is disoriented and erratic
I'm left with cash and thangs on the ride
While all of they efforts ladies criticise
Then analyse, then finalise
Then put me number one after they categorise
All rivals will either
Run from the battle, or get pounced by a beaver
Shiner, that bare chicks bring the gift
Of letting their clothes slip off for the top G, mallin'
One reason why I make, so I'm never fallin'

Just to show I-
I'm going in the mall stuntin'
Just to show I-
Imma drop 40k on it
Just to show I-
Hear me clowning, money ain't nothing

[Verse 1]
Y'all don't see my having all this bread
Y'all better put a price on my head
I dun lost all value of money because I get so much for doing almost nothing
The cash coming in so easy, If I said how much you'd be hard pressed to believe me
I wake up when I want
Everyday of the week to pick up bank accounts and my royalties
They pay me in US cash and even in Euros, it's got me feeling like an international hero
I'm getting money from countries I ain't even know exist
I'm like mad, how I hit a stain like this
I'm getting stacks so great, I'm getting some and flipping it in real estate
Some in the service company some in products
Got a feeling my meter broke on good luck
Go in good luck I'm stuck and it won't change after even 1 million bucks
It'll still be heavy and roast up
Champagne, a gold chain and a silk brush

Cowards talking: you could never prove the same
With the break I make it's hard to refrain
From acting mad and maternally
Let me tell you all about my day:
From when I get up to down my head I lay
I get up after 12 noon
Waking up to something bad in my bedroom
I always take 'em out to a 5 star
Some place they never ate, with a top bar
Spared no expense, mixed drank until we buzzed
With the lifestyle of a thug, she in love
Back to the mall
Get some things just to prove I can buy it all
Almost dinner time, usually 9 dine in
Yellow pages cuisine, random point, dial it
Corn flip [?] other side [?]
Magic with me so I'm heaped at by haters
Head to the party spot with a chick so bad I just might get shot

Envious cause I'm getting this bread

Keep playin, this game is over
Keep playin, this here you can't fold
Never really understood why they want my life
Probably cause the swag cut, it was a night
Amazed, seeing plenty of money
Laughing at these bustas cause they swear it's funny

Cause they were dealing with a real G

Of money

Cuties come in and out from my habitat
As I stang licks and watch these boys crash
These dudes steady get wrecked
By me as ladies neglect
To show them any love
They give it all to me, I'm peaceful as a dove

Hoopin' is all I know
Catch one of 'em slippin’, two-hand hanger on the goal
Fam, that's for real
Dunk on the comp and see how they feel
It's time to jump out the gym
APLs on my feet got me high above the rim
Two-hand follow-up dunks is my specialty
So I follow every layup, tryna get one for me
Ten point games, ten minute clock
Winner stay up, loser does not
Shots and layups' one point, three pointer's two points
First team to ten get to stay on the joint
Whole court, hoop court that is
If we get a lead, I'm gon' get a snowbird in

I'm thugged out, deep in the cut
Run yourself up, you guaranteed to get pumped
Up by the sawed-off
Blew off your head, and your body got tossed
I'm a ruthless assassin out the southwest
Guaranteed to put a hole in your chest
It's best to chill 'fore you get killed
If you act stupid, I promise I will
Make sure that your blood is spilled
And leave you faceless, with no will
Left right on the side of the road is your dead corpse
I burn out, emotionless, with no remorse
Far as I'm concerned, it's just another bitch-nigga gone
I laugh about it to myself as I roll on
Another ruthless hit
And another snitch-trick dead in a ditch

Ho ass niggas promise that they stressin' that they some G's
We gon' find out 'cause they came short with my cheese
First nigga hopped out, caught his ass in the Jeep
Silencer kept the peace, you couldn't hear a peep
Follow busta stuck at the door, tryin' to get out
That's the one I aimed on and caught in the mouth
Driver tried to peel out, caught him through the window
Now it's only one left cryin' like a little ho
Beggin' for his life, fag, cryin' like a little bitch
Motherfuck that trick, should've came with my shit
Stuffed the hater in the head, but a G ain't done
Set the car on fire, blaze it up for fun
Then a thug burn out, top down in the wind
Thinkin' to myself, ""I gotta do this again""
'Cause it was real, when them fake niggas do this

For a thousand Loracets, will I make bail?

See we loopin' down the roads, and we pushin' tight loads
And we movin' in a row, everybody knows
That we showin' up at the party thick, in a line
Peep as the gleam puts haze in they eye
It's early, time to make a loop
So I'm back on the streets, ridin' in a coupe
Big body, my niggas in addition
While I'm lacked out listenin' to friction
Comin' from the rattlin' speaker play
More washed than the sunshine state
Turn up the speakers, let the bass get loud
Volume on eight, 'bout to move the crowd
Man, it's comin' out the back of the trunk
Fifteens bout to get the place crunk
Like Keenan Wayans, some say I should be ashamed
The way my bass goes 'round in a maze
'Bout to go through the parking lot, everything is hot
Get a beat and it's pop the top
Crystal clear sound that's comin' out my tweeters
Cold weather bumpin', no need for the heater
Yes, it's boomin' and I'm hearin' it all in my ear
Got a player trippin' in brand-new year
It's the age of the thug, and I gotta let my system go
Filter low, got a player think he speakers blown
But they not, and put the switch back on high
Now the ground is shakin' like 9.5
On the Richter, 'bout to head to the car wash
My car be jamming, no hogwash
'Bout to let the rap thump, let the words hit
Got more tracks than the '96 Olympics
Them boys see me ridin' through loud
Smart with the volume, knowin' when to turn it down
Left turn on the one-way, keepin' it the fly way
Now I'm jumping on the highway
On my way to the scene, steppin' out shinin'
The laser in my changer keeps the synchronized timin'
Time to go to Mako, gotta choose
'98 blue, 2000 maroon
Knock out the dents, make my ride look new

So don't get sent to the sea as I throwaway

Til they find themselves slumped on a pillow that's silk
Now sleepin' sideways, and face up in a box
In a brand new suit, ballin' on dirtlocked
Straight up parlayin', puttin' in dreams
Church suited up, leavin' out clean
You don't want that to be you, so go keep it real
You my customer, you make me money, so don't get killed
You buy my music, and peep my words
And make sure the things out my mouth get heard
So don't stop that, what would it be worth
To test me and lose your life, and go back in a hearse?

Cause I'm the best, but there's better ways to channel their anger

And take it from me, infamy is underwhelming
Cause I keep shellin' cash in my net worth

They like plant marks, they come from bark
Want to be hard, but end up soft
There can only be one me, there'll never be another
That's why cutie pies want mе under they covers
I discovеr any opps' plan
To win before it's implemented and [?]
And broke down into something fictitious
These haters can't understand a thug's renditions
It's probably because they all lightweight
I stay true to the stang while others lose they cake
I'm quick to leave foes in shambles and rubble
While cuties flock to a hoodlum in triples and doubles
Any other in this grind, it's my job to demolish
As bad chicks in the cut make sure I'm polished

Takin' they life as a mothafuckin' joke
Boys rollin' dice with they life
And I don't give a fuck, I'll make a widow out yo wife
I like to roll through the hood in my Benz
And if you bein' a bitch, I ain't makin' a friend
You roll yourself into a wall
When in your mouth is this nigga who ain't got it all
I roll solo, fool
Fuck you and your boys, what y'all gonna do
But get rolled over?
Leave you dead in my truck and set fire to my Rover
Then I roll out, sayin' ""Fuck my Range""

She roll her tongue and show me her tongue ring
I put in carats, so across the room I see it bling
My girls roll quarters to see who hit me first
I like the oil, sometimes the same flipped or reversed
Roll the punches if you wanna
But you're gonna end up in a coma
'Cause I roll out a blast to the chest
It's impossible to win 'cause I'm the best
As I roll my paper with my girls on my mind
Haters know they can't stop me, and I'm stuck on shine
So I roll on a baller's mission:
Mash on boys and crush competition

When I'm hiding in your house for you to come in
It's the last thing you remember
When you went in the bathroom and you left never
Or when you was looking at me in the mirror
Nine hit your head and you can no longer hear a G
Dragging you out the place
Eyes closed with a blank look on your face
And you woke up in my chair
Thinking to yourself life ain't fair

Foreign whips, foreign models, like a foreign nation

They can't retaliate, cause how badly they injured
Mortal attack comes from me, the sender
The victory goes to me, the winner

To the ruins with these marks I'm sendin them
Straight to oblivion
All rappers conceded by me, they educated
But if they get out of line they get devastated
All the while bad chicks check my face
They fall through and check my place
Interest outstanding got my stacks climbing miles
My stacks increasing like backup files
Challengers I quickly erode
And decimate in a squabble episode
They hopes of escape is imagination
I'm shining with a hustler persuasion
I'm grinding, (?)
Im the coldest in the game, as quotes from a journalist
My combatants loss is final
They accept defeat and don't renew the rivalry
With a maller
I hit a stang, now I'm the top caller
These busta's know, what's up
I'm dawging chumps, month to month
Last check to check, not like they livin'
Meanwhile, to the stang swag I'm gettin'
Opposition is pathetic
I unleash an offense that's too hectic
I'm a (?), that needs no introduction
Locked on non-stop cash eruption
Cutie pies love me and set the mood
Because I treat challengers so crude
My reality is they dreamed oasis
Stayin on my money, while they stay complacent

They lives in shambles and they can't replace it

Making top cash while these marks wait
Wonderin' why y'all fake
It don't make sense
It don't matter, I'm the realest thing that there ever did
All these haters jealous 'cause they envy my swagger
Hit you with the heat and make your ass fall backwards
Fuck what they sayin', my clique is the shit
I'm the realest in the grind and these bustas feel it
When I step up to a killer
I decapitate a snitch and then go dealer
Bad bitches with my little nigga
Can drop one of you bustas like the flour in the miller
I heard your clique finished last
Word in the hood, y'all ain't makin' no cash
While I'm out here, movin' this cocaine
Makin' so much, they has you marks goin' insane
I done made it my mission
To treat these haters like competition
It's got me wonderin' will they ever get they money right?
It's got me happy that they'll never join this lavish life

Ready to bust, and ready to explode
On the first mark with his eyes on my grip
Thinking he fast enough to get a G on a slip
But it ain't going down like that
Imma be the first with a round at his gat
And hit you in your hat
And watch as your bitch-ass body fall back
I stay ready for that hoe shit
Hit a boy wig, I gotta split

I'm a thug that destroys combatants whereva
It's like I'm thunder the way I bring tha weatha
When I clown these boys they claim they not embarrassed
But how can that be when the girls they scarin?
The ladies flock to me through the conflict duration
Meanwhile these boys game plans need alterations
After they loss they run back to they clique fast
But it don't matter 'cause nobody in they clique has
The talent to beat this G they know what they facin'
When it's bout testin' me it's best to do a cancellation
'cause when boys think they can beat me
I help em see, they i-mag-in-ing
I'm the power behind the grind, its generator
Men lose to me, and it don't get greater later
Dudes are jealous
Of my shine
But not enough
To come try mine

I roll big bank
I stack all day
My cash don't cease
It just increase

[Verse 2]


My diamonds shine, so bright whereas
Boys want to be in my shoes but they can't handle the task
Of being the best
In the hustle of course
My call out for competition goes unenforced
My shine and grind go together, they don't alternate
Meanwhile all these men broke
And stuck with no cake
And when they finally step up
They lose then bail
Give em' a heartless assault, cuz they tested my mail
I light 'em up, like a candle
With a barrage of strikes, that they can't handle
I'm the one and only, while these dudes are all the same
Busted pocked bustas that'll always be lame
Foes minus me is me, do the math
They choose they routes wisely, and don't take this path
'cause when they do it's imminent destruction
They self-esteem I shatter, their confidence I busted

(hahahaaaaa)
I’m locked on win
That’s how this story begins
Every day for me is a big vacation
No end to my cash, so anywhere I’ll be placin'
My body, every day
I’m coming up in so many ways
Always parlayin, just havin fun
The 2013’s just came out so I gotta get one
Truth is it's tricky even if you got it
That’s why im the only one with silver in my pockets
Ballin', that's all I know
I do this rapping shit for fun, this ain't' how I make my dough
You ain't' know? (you ain't know?), I was made before the rap game
I was six figures before I chose my rap name
It's my looks that makes the girls go crazy
And my money that makes these pussy niggas want to erase me

Got boys in fantasies livin' make believe
Dreaming, they could be like me
But that’s a wish that they’ll never see
All they doin' is pretending
They all stuck on broke, no cash winnin'
In the beginning, I was hood rich
One of karma’s rewards for not turnin' snitch
Did my penitentiary time, and didn’t say shit
Then came my two-two hundred racks that I went in with

Catch me made all the time, watch me keep mine

[Verse 1]
These boys never see a cash emergence
All the while, I suppress they grind insurgence
Even if they could get past they inconsistencies
They could never get past my supremacy
Competition can't keep up
With my shine, so they stay in my dust
I'm making cash like I'm a paper factory
All the cuties tell me they in love with me
I'm that hustler that'll never lose
Catch me breaking through so they know they'll never do
A thug like me is a grinder
I'm too major, while these fellas are minor
It's always me that the models pick
For several reasons, one of them is cause I'm rich
These dudes come to war being refused
To accept the news
That in the battle, they were crushed
And my hustle was just too much

These boys paper ain't increasible
Cause I make sure that ain't feasible

Need to be they man and always be joining
The way I mash on dudes is honorable
They don't give a life, ain't tolerable
Stang after stang is my normal occurence
As I keep these men hold and uncoherent
I rise from every battle
As the only man all the ladies desire
And with whom they lay

But they don't escape a demise that's exclusive
My diamonds give me so much illumination
That dudes give me even more ballerhation
I'll never stop ballin, that's my word
As it's me all the pretty girls reserve
Leaving these fellas rowdy
They nights cold and they days cloudy
These boys are jealous cause licks fell off
And they wanna take it out on a baller that floss
But it just makes me ball harder
And watch as these marks fall flat in the water

Alcor Life Extension (Outro),"lcor Life Extension (Outro) Lyrics[Intro]
Know this isn't someone's vision of heavenly ice. This is liquid nitrogen, used in the process of cryonic preservation. You're looking at the body of a fifteen-year-old man who has just moments ago been pronounced dead of colon cancer
And these people are medical personnel from the American Cryonic Society, with whom he contracted to be frozen, right here, in his own living room. Alerted by cell phone, they have arrived within moments of his death to begin the process of cryonic preservation. We are watching the patient being packed in ice as the cooling down process has begun. In this first stage, he will be ventilated, medications such as anticoagulants, antioxidants and other drugs, his temperature, [?], and so on, will be constantly monitored, and his blood will be gradually pumped out and be replaced with a water-based coolant
After these initial steps, the patient gets transported by ambulance to one of the society's facilities. Over a period of up to a week, the patient's temperature will gradually be lowered as he is placed in a series of tanks and cooling boxes, filled with liquid nitrogen. Ultimately, all his blood will be washed out and replaced by a combination of medically treated cooled liquids and ice. And finally, encased in a tube, he will be lowered into his permanent resting place in this vacuum vault, which will then be placed underground to await the day he returns to life. He won't wait alone, by the way. The vault is large enough to hold four full bodies, and two heads

When I buy a lighthouse, I gotta wear shades
I'm lookin' like a thugged-out ambassador
My diamonds [?] going fast enough
Said when they putting me on TV
The reflections from the diamonds makin' 3 of me
I'm thugged-out ballin' fo' sho'
But still got the shiny [?] if I got it, any glow
Now you know who it be
'Cause shiny gangstas ain't V-I-P-E
My car shiny too, my system always bang
It's a trip how the diamonds hang

And wonderin', could you catch me on the sly

And wonderin', could you catch me on the sly
While I'm thinkin' ""I wish you'd try""

[Verse 1]
I'm ballin', through your area
While these boys looking scarier
I got 'em froze up, wonderin' ""Could they catch a G?""
But they know that it's me
They heard what I say, that I keep big gats
And they wonderin', should they chance on that?
It's on you, go and roll the dice
But I'ma tell you that four ain't nothing nice
You'll end up in a garbage bag quick
For trying to get my profits
Tell me now, why these boys wanna take my cash
When they know that them hollow points move fast?
I know that being broke ain't cool
But you'd rather be content with being alive, fool
'Cause if you don't and you start trippin'
I'ma make sure that your flesh catch a rippin'

Draped up, in diamonds and tight clothes
Then only dunkin' two-hand hangers
And got boys enrollin' in anger
Management classes for they tempers
Even though they agg', they hide away they whimpers
I changed the game and the way it's played
'Cause I'm the type they ain't want to get paid
It's too late, I'm already locked in it
My cash coming in faster than I can spend it
See, hatred is bad for ya health

Tried to stop the shine, you're stuck out like a splinter

I got both these haters playing pick up sticks (Thugging)
I was in the block hittin' licks (Deep on the block)
I got both these haters playing pick up sticks (Thugging)
I was in the cut hitting stangs
Nothing changed but the amount of cocaine
Moving work, touching snow
Come to find out, haters wanna sleep me on the low
And bury me at sea
But you'll know that ain't the place for V
But now I'm doing things I done got legal
These haters eyeballin' me like a eagle
But I still keep a fat pack from the rats
Cause I'm the realest of the dogs, the coolest of the cats

But underneath that, these nothing but curls
Black and white diamonds on my chain
Got these boys wanting to blow my brain

Kept the fade factory 'cause it's a new ride
But I bump, so I had to put the box inside
Front windows ain't got no tint
I want the girls to see me when they lookin' in
And the bustas can see the four
If they get too close when they pass below
At a baller's pace is how I like to clown
Hustla ridin', sittin' low to the ground

Before it's implemented and scanned
And broke down into something fictitious
These haters can't understand a thug's renditions
It's probably because they all lightweight
I stay true to the stang while others lose they cake

Males fall off cause it's them I crush
Come into my zone and it's lethal danger
These dudes only look right when they face is filled with anger
Groupies come up and ask for a hug
But they get much more cause with all the girls I score
All the cuties around me is all I know, that's normal

Whisperin' in my ear first date, in them guts she'll let me slide (Holla)

Risin' to the occasion, takin' time flight
Another day on the hoop court undefeated
Even them niggas in the NBA cannot beat me
Knock off babes shower up, then hit the club twenty deep
Stupid cash in my pockets, everythang on me (It's easy)

Your hustle stuck on front, my hustle stuck on stunt

If you ain't marks, stay on your J-O-B
Do whatever you gotta do to get like me
And keep it one-hundred, homie, your age is how you should act

Act big tough, with my lil nigga
Been droppin' on you busta's, likе the Thrilla in Manila

Word in the hood, y'all ain't makin' no cash
While I'm out here movin' this cocaine
Makin' so much cash, you marks goin' insane

To treat these haters like competition

After they lost they run back to they clique fast
But it dont matter cause nobody in they clique last
They tell em to beat this G they know what they facin
When it's bout testing me it's best to do a cancellation
Cause when boys think they can beat me

Cash is what I feel, cash is what I touch
The money game changed my frame to Billy Goat Gruff
The walls are closing in, cutting deep like a knife
I feel like Julius Caesar on the day he lost his life
The downpour of money is kinda hard to control
It's like a plague burning a hole in my soul
The money's like a monkey on my back
With a Glock .4-5 at my head for a jack
Moved, now I'm looking for other [?]
A quiet place that will bring me up off the green
And give me the strength that I need
To be a pillar of my community
Does such a place exist, or is it just a dream?
If it does, can somebody take me?
Cause this flesh is getting weak
And the time I got left is fleeting
And if I don't make it there soon
It'll be the death of the bride's groom

But took a look at how I'm pursued
One reason is cause my cash insurance
Hardships they won't have to endure
I sell every confrontation with enemies
With a malicious attack and a victory
I cut through foes' defence flag
My offence is something they can't withstand
I 'hole boys, they fall off and try and remerge
Then I give them another smashing that they deserve
I destroy them again with relentless aggression
After that, hotties freak me in an all night session

Might burn your eyes like a solar flare
Some by my jewels make the girls share
They bodies once they locked in my glare they get bare
It's my job to make you see
Why I’m the center of men's envy
I make boys see what I'm saying
In the shine game I'm the top dog playing
Boys wishing they could be like me
But the bottom line is they ain't raw enough, these
Marks will understand why my pockets so lumpy
Theirs so thin and mine so chunky
It's cause I hustle and hit licks
And they ain't on they paper chase while time ticks
Keep them aggravated cause my shine don't quit

Took the thumb out your mouth, and found your own home

I'm makin' money, know what I'm talkin' bout?
Last week I did a double cashout
I'm gettin' so much money that it's causin' confusion
Haters jealous of my swag, and they cash is illusion
Snitch cliques are jealous 'cause of all my bread
Word on the street, they want a price on my head
Catch me sellin' work on the back of a dim street
Same street, catch me in the back with some dim heat
Money's what I know now, money's all I see
If they would have offered me less time, I woulda took the plea
I stole the hustles, and yea I had to do the time
I thought about the consequence before I did the crime
Snitch trick cliques ready, and hit me up
And now I got the attitude that I don't give a fuck
I did my beat and now I'm out the penitentiary
And you can find me on your best side cause they done let me free

[Verse 2]
Cocaine game got crazy
But I had hit another stang, cause the caine made me
So now, you can find me on your best side
Servin up your hood, while rollin' in a new ride
And now it's haters, praying that I touch lead
And now it's haters, praying for my death bed
And yet these rats always lookin
Simpleton ass niggas wanna get you for the cookin'
But they won't put me in no ghetto
No matter how much money, it won't get me to settle
Down, in this cocaine movement'
I move the caine, while the other dealers losin'
Haters, jealous of a dope boy
I'm movin caine so clean, that my name should be coke boy
I'll sell ya powder, and I'll sell ya rocks
I'll be your pusher till you lay in that box

Find me water whippin' in the trap
While straight dropping a pack
Come to find out these marks be hating
Jealous of my swag and cash I'm making
It's me cutie pies can't resist
Haters pray to test me but thеy got dissed
Catch me out herе clowning

My piece? No
My loot? No
My sides? No
My main thangs? Nah

[Verse 2]
Conceited? Yes
Confident? Yes
Peep the swag in my step
Arrogant? Yes
Narcissistic? Yes
It's like a hot stud can't get over himself
Could it be all this money I make?
I ain't gotta do nothing if the sky's to my face
All I do is parlay while the world spins around
Meanwhile my bank account jumping up like a clown
It's got a nigga wondering what'd I do to get so blessed?
Taking straight-up killer whips, bad broads, I'm a mess
I make these haters want to put my life to a test
Still I don't wear a vest, nigga I'm too fresh
[Chorus]
Who do I love more than me?
Who do I want more than me?
My cribs? No
My cars? No
My clothes? No
My chains? No
Who do I need more than me?
Who do I love more than me?

Have You Sick In A Hoop Game,"ave You Sick In A Hoop Game Lyrics[Chorus]
Ballin', grindin' fo' sho' (Cash in your face)
Lettin' boys know about my swag
Grindin, hustlin' fo' sho' (Never seen a hustler do his thang)
Watch me as I pop these tags
Grindin, hustlin' fo' sho' (Never seen a pretty boy ball)
Lettin' boys know about my swag
Grindin, hustlin' fo' sho' (Have you sick in a hoop game in the mall)
Watch me as I pop these tags

[Verse 1]
The cutie pie's hearts I capture
Leavin' boys wanting my life and after
They see the way I ball, for the first time
Sendin' me to oblivion is deep in they mind
I'm locked on grind, and gettin' anything
That money can buy, and money can bring
I'm big cash, big bank, stackin' cake
Look at my shine and the cash I make!
I'm locked in this game, and winnin' major
And turning all these boys into haters
You should hear the way all the girls say hey
To this G, you should see my pay
You should see my green bills
The money that I make, got these boys on chill
Another reason is I got all the girls
But the main reason is I'm the cutest in the world

I make these boys see they reason for livin' is invalid
And only my life can be peaceful and passive
I'm every woman in the world's favorite dish
You can find me on every lady's wishlist
And in the meantime
These dudes are still baller hatin' and want my life
'Cause all the girls I flatter
By my looks, assets, and cake batter
Of exquisite things, I'm the top connoisseur
And known around the world as the top entrepreneur
To be like me is what all men strive for
But there can only be one me, so it makes that void
I destroy these fella's self-esteem
And leave them in a constant state of self pity
'Cause my shine is untamed
And my grind and my name can't be defamed

Move a little slower now, not too fast
So a G can see what he gon' get to smash
Now move it from the bottom left, to the right corner
Show that way I shine a goner
See, now he'll get to pay

My love with this girl got a thug confused
Sometimes I don't know what to do
My love for her so deep it pierce my soul
I thought I had it figured out but I was wrong
I'm confused, this girl got my head spinnin'
I wish that I could start the script from the beginning
She's likе a key to a door that's slightly out my reach
And the door locks can't bе breached
I thought I had her figured out, but I was wrong
And now a thug tryna send her a new song
The question is, will she listen?
It's got me tryna create a new mission
To get her on my team
To get her doing everything I need
To get her to take a chance and roll the dice
On a thug, so she sees that I'm something nice

Not moving too slow or with too much haste

To win, baby girl, and to do it in the right way
The money caught her eye but it seems she want more
Like a faithful thug, ready to love her, so
I'mma be that figure, ain't nothin left to do
But to confess my love and prove to her I'll be true
She said she'd be my one and only
If I treat her right and never leave her lonely
So that's what I'ma do
You can count on me, girl, this heart's safe for you

And let them bullets come straight at your ecaf

But everybody know that was just some noise
You wasn't gone do nothing, or back it up
Cause if you do, on my life you getting stuck with a knife
And a gun, and everything else

What is the shelf? The shelf of can of soup
Only bitch ass dudes go for talking foolish
To some heartless killers
Pussy ass boy, you ain't know I was a thriller
I'll leave you dead, sleeping in a ditch
Then backdoor and sleep with your main bitch

Steak and Ale or some place discrete
Cause boys already gone be sick

I'll look over as you look so fine
As we start dinnеr off with a bottle of wine
We'll ridе in my new Infiniti truck
Cause I ain't drove it once since I bought it last month
And that club from earlier that you speak
We can't go there, I did a show there last week
And the girls over there wanna get with me
And I don't wanna see you have to protect yourself from fe-

Cause that'll probably throw it off for you
Seeing fifty dimes rushing at your trues
So when we go in, we'll try to stay silent
Just follow me and the light streams from my diamonds
We'll chill in VIP and keep my shit on the low
As I order any drink that you never had before
Oh, you wanna try Hpnotiq?
Yeah, it tastes good, I don't think that you'll knock it
But if you do, I'll get some Pérignon
Twelve-hundred a pop, guaranteed to turn you on
Followed up by sixteen French bottles of wine
I plan to make sure that you have a good time
And you never forget this night
When everything was just right

Smashed that pussy like a dog in a heat

Kind of like a crack head fiendin' for cake
These see me rollin', in my eight-fifty
All the stars, they wanna come get me
I park my car, and make a phone call
As they tappin' on my windows and want it all
My limo driver answers and she come scoop me up
She comes through grindin' in my black stretch truck
Ever seen a balla sucked in a long whip
Follow up with a mob of dimes who wants a free tip?

It's cold, the way I destroy these males
My paper grind is exclusive and unique
And my grind shine is shiny and sleek
Never lost a battle givin' boys defeat they need
They leave the battle disrespected in defeat
To the pretty girls I'm their only
Priority that they carry
They care of me as I sit back and recline
Gettin' service with unlimited time
My life so easy I never had a ripple
I make ballin' lavishly, look so simple

[Verse 2]
All the girls blush when I come in they presence
My swag chicks love my aura and my essence
I mash enemies with destructive malice
And make them respect my best of the grind status
To boys I'm heartless but to girls I'm mild and meek
One reason why the ladies come and take a peek
Of me in private, and you know what's gon' happen
I'm livin' a dream, as my pockets fatten
And that's why every woman's passion is to be in my life
My cash climb is fast
Meanwhile I keep these males livin' in the past
Peep play, I make boys never neglect
To wonder how this game would be if I wasn't in it
Cuz in the infamy game I'm the livin' evidence
Since I got infamy it ain't been the same since

And now the money fallin' from the ceilin'

To know you never again, worry about a bill
And not have to worry, how you belly gon' be filled
And now the big cash, keep girls feisty
As hater's prayin for my down fall, cause they shiesty

Touching cocaine with the chicken wings
Seems like the haters want me to fail
And if I touch the jail again, they won't pay my bail
So  I'm doing this on my own
Kinda like how I roll on my chrome
Money is my mission, so I won't stop
Either that, or til the grind give me my props
I pray that's coming on a near day
Til then, I'll keep touching this yay

The grind got tedious, so some Gs dipped

Moving this cocaine gone set me free

I can't count all the time models shows up on me
Thugs, yeah, it's a trip
And star models tell me I make they's heart still
And me, I destroy these boys
They all immobile

And it makes me wanna do me fine

Waitin for fate to push a malla over the gate

But still put in work and have my people say they miss this
Cashed up shinin, staying on this lick
Imagine these haters wanna turn cheeks

For the skin and then throw grams of under thing
You's on the knee
On the hill, allergic to the wild, on the top
I don't budge
Uh, I'll be
All the pretty girls are grooves
Cause I wanna lick for paying my dues

[Verse 2]
While men have lost their hope
That's from my grind, my run
They can't cope
On their knees, ladies saying they wanna be tastin'
I'm straight laid, dick, cash is what I'm blazing
And each other, wanna test my skin
Get crushed before they even see the deed
In the end
They remain nameless
And in the end
Their remains remain painless

You gone work with me lady
I'm gone flirt with you baby
We can take it slow
We ain't got nowhere to go
You gone work with me lady

We can take all night

[Verse 3]
These fellas are nuisances
Their value of zero
Which mean you's useless
They gone emotions are hard
Cause every girl hits my van and keeps me warm
How I match on each cash is under laid
Like how I'm paid
There's no way
My diamonds shine, like the sun
The hustle's on mine, the diamonds means I won

[Verse 4]
Cutie pie, thug on me, like a whore
They like to show me up
And boys' heart try hard
Grooves real nice
They can't pay
They bad, compared to when they see I have a baller lady
My heart's got too hectic
Girls are nice to be as if I'm a man
My soul, dick, I stay closin'
The ladies feel me for one day closin'
[Chorus]
You gone work with me lady
I'm gone flirt with you baby
We can take it slow
We ain't got nowhere to go

Top  choice money got me quick on my feet
On top of that, I'm feeling so unique
Street sweepers and pistols pointed at my dome
Will they think about me after they hit me with the chrome?
But I'm still climbing
Money falling out the air as I'm shining
I wonder why I'm fortunate like this
Major dividends got me feeling so confident
I made the paper, yet the paper made me
Into a top choice celebrity
I be the G that they wanna see
[?] and lifeless, stretched out on a gurney
I made a deal with the Devil
If he make me rich, I might not smash his chick
You's a snitch if you think you could stop me
Others have tried even with carbon copies
Of me, but I can't be cloned
Money ain't nothing but a means to pearls and stones

Watch the way that I'm shinin'
I'm changin' the rap game from white gold to white diamonds
Watch the way that I'm shinin'
I'm changin' the rap game from white gold to white diamonds

[Verse 1]
I'll keep these haters in check
I ride new whips while they ride wrecks
I just mall
And trip because I got it all
The jewelry around my neck
Hurts so bad 'cause it's so heavy on that
Man, it's a trip
You should see how these white diamonds flip
So I added the black diamonds to clown
Now these boys bitin' my style all the way around
And it's got me trippin'
I should take off my belt and commence to whippin'
These rappers and give 'em a spankin'
Look at how these diamonds clankin'
I was the first to wear all white gold
I'm wearin' all white diamonds and they done bit that too
That's how it's told

[Chorus]
Watch the way that I'm shinin'
I'm changin' the rap game from white gold to white diamonds
Watch the way that I'm shinin'

My cash is clean and my diamonds are white
And these boys gon' go blind 'cause they shine so bright
The money game changed and the diamond game changed too
But my swag stayed the same, so I'm always lookin' brand new
I thought you knew I'd need shoestrangs to tie my cash
And I'm climbin' up the rap game, these boys are trash
Try to clash and the last thing you hear was me blastin'
As I'm holdin' my trigger, sendin haters to their caskets
As I ride in the cadillac
Diamonds on my neck make these haters sit back
Diamonds on my wrist, and they don't know how to act
Diamonds on my pipe, and these cowards don't smoke crack

[Chorus]
Watch the way that I'm shinin'
I'm changin' the rap game from white gold to white diamonds

And these haters are jealous cause my cash wasn't fallin'
Hatin' on the wins cause we grindin'
Jealous of the piece and chains cause we shinin'

[Verse 1]
I'm back on top of the stang
Haters are mad cause they couldn't hang
I'm getting plenty
As snitches are mad cause they snitching can't get me
Wanting to snitch on my 'caine sales
And see me with no bail
But my moves too quick
To get caught up behind these state cliques
So I just roll with my crew
Real Gs, who know just what to do
With a hater
Bust they head now, and bust they head later
Now my cash is major
Left and right money, just like a fader
This cash make me a top player
And to my ego it cater

[Verse 2]
And now that I'm paid
Haters refuse to acknowledge that I'm made
I hit a lick and now I'm set for life
Instead, I don't even have to roll no dice
Cause it ain't about luck
It's about how much cash I can tuck
Cause I got it all

Money, checks in my mailbox
Boys can't get it, cuz that there's a stash spot
And that's not all, I got other cash lots:
Banks, my crib, my pockets in fat knots

A G never slacking
A hustler done got stuck on paper stacking
Making cash, in other words
Came kicking punks to the curb
Always pushing something nice
Always covered in ice
Draped up from head to toe
But when it gets dirty, it's gots to go
Down, in my hood
I'm G'd up hustling and it's all good
Shining, in every way
Under my shirt - the three eight-

They think that they can catch me slipping
Making sure life of haters ain't fair

I grind and shine, somethin' cuties well know
I'm the king of the hustle, my talent is noble
My sentences come natural, my groupies come global
Boys are froze, to this game, it's timid and fragile
As the way I chill every day is casual
I got cash everywhere, I'm somethin' more than a bank
""Which model to take?"" An example of hard decisions I make
All the cuties call me they insurance
I ain't hit my prime, while [?] stack with endurance
Ice around my neck lights up the place
Invisible sets on white diamond lace
Catch me paper-callin', January through December
As stars jump on my team as new cash winnin' members

But I'mma be the one to put these marks to the test

I'll shoot you in your head before you can flex about fame
I'mma show these boys what the dirty south is all about
When I bust your homie with that pistol all in his mouth
I tried to tell you that your clique was hoes
You should've joined my crew, but you wanted to be a bitch though
So now I'm gon' make you pay
Watch out for that motherfuckin' AK spray

I told you I was in the game, real talk
I don't just spit the words, I walk the walk
Check my swag, nigga you gon' see it's one-hundred percent
And the cash I got, can't be spendin'

Quick attack, there's no slack in my back
In the scеne, wearing all black
They acting like they know me, man, who are you?
They call me Viper, but these boys knew
Who I was before they stepped up to me
And they'll know even better when they're in a deep sleep
Cause I'm not one to mess with, I ride or die
I do it for the southwest, as my ride glides
They jealous they can't move like me
That's why they're living so desperately
As I'm cruising through H-town
Bumping Screw in the 'lac, and I'm never ever going down
Cause I'm a G eternally
So I do it for the streets before they murder me

They gone be laying in the mud

Keep your clique close but keep your enemies closer
