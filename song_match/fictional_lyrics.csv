Violent,"Shit get ugly, everybody with me thuggin'
We keep that pistol out, no regular clips, we loud, you know we clutchin' (Blrrrd, blrrrd, blrrrd-blrrrd)
I stand formal with my gang and ain't no nigga gon' do nothing (Ain't no nigga gon' do shit)
Snuck in the club with a ten-millimeter, regular clip a dozen
And this Gucci backpack filled with racks, try something, I press that button
I break that automatic folding chop out my Louis V luggage
Still got respect for all the old hoes, rode my dick when I was nothing
Got some money, now I'm fucking twin sisters, mamas, cousins"
Violent,"It's fuck you off the rip if you ain't CG or the set, yup (If you ain't CG or the set)
All y'all still gotta go, you ain't gotta line up, it don't matter who next
(Gotta line up, it don't matter who next)
Catch me with two red twins on side of me like Johnny Test (Like Johnny Test)
Enemigo I know fucked up, for pesos, he chop ya flesh (Chop ya flesh)
I'm too slow to pour the twelve, I think Wock' was my best invest (Wock', Wock', Wock')
And when it's me, 30, and Veeze, they triple team and choose the threat (Choose the threat)
Ho, don't ask what I want for my birthday, give me what's under your head
No, I can't burn your top for free, need your prescription for the meds
These niggas know I take beef serious
Tryna fake they death, I know they ain't dead (Bitch, I know you ain't dead)
375 breed monsters, but we don't come from under the bed (Yeah)
Drop the load, niggas know where we at (We at)
Better know shorty shoot shot, all net (Shorty shoot shot, all net)
These blue hundreds will open her legs (Her legs)
She love when I spray it, it's makin' her wet, blrrrd, blrrrd"
Violent,"My youngins focused with them sticks, I give a job, they get it done (Let's go)
He couldn't make it to the doctor, no hospital when we come (Nope)
My trigger finger be itchin' all the way down to my palm (Blrrrd)
I just did the spread challenge, runnin' through hundreds on my arm (You see it)
We keep mixed exotic flavors, we smoke Backwoods 'til we done (I'm sayin')
But you know I stay on point, quick to walk you down if you run (For sure)
First day locked, I'm makin' bond, it ain't hard to tell we got funds (Nope)
Got a Glock 19 up on my hip, this bitch my favorite gun (Blrrrd)
Love the way it hit, don't got a kick, I shoot this bitch for fun (This bitch don't got a kick)
I'm 1017, this watch up on my wrist is one-of-one (Them diamonds on me hit)
Seven shots come out the drum if you try to reach like you dumb (Go)
That lil' killer from the slums, said he promote the Murder One (Let's go)"
Violent,"I knew I was gon' catch a body at ten (Blrrrd, blrrrd)
Gotta hop out on feet every time that we spin (Wan' spin)
Wanna get with my gang, cost death to get in (Yeah, yeah)
Try to reach for my chain? You off meth or some med'
Face shot long range, turn to Steph with the SIG
Keep focus every time, better ask how [?]
Got a day, goin' out like 'Pac, I'm big (I'm big)
Everybody 'round me buyin' green (Let's go)
And we big C gang, what the fuck you mean? (Blrrrd, blrrrd)
Everybody you know my team (Blrrrd)
Still posted on the block like I'm Yao Ming (Blrrrd, blrrrd)
Chrome Hearts hat with the long sleeves (Long sleeves)
In the Rolls-Royce truck blowin' 'za with some freaks
If I want him dead, I just pay, the shit cheap
Get one in the head, know L-A play for keeps (Yeah)
Just peeped your gang, shit weak (Shit weak)
Can't run it on me, I'm too slimy and [?] (No, no)
Ayy, shoutout to TP, he cooked up the beat (Cooked up the beat)
Got some [?], [?] try that with me
Been and stood front line, real beef (Blrrrd)"
Violent,"
One shot to the head (Baow), may he rest in peace (Wow)
I'm the reason doctors hooked him up, I feel like Master P (Feel like Master P)
I just woke up out my dream 'cause I ain't feel my drink with me
(Where the fuck my drink?)
Everybody with me slime, damn, yeah, I got snakes with me
(We got slime and we some snakes)
One shot to the head (Baow), may he rest in peace (Wow)
I'm the reason doctors hooked him up, I feel like Master P (Feel like Master P)
I just woke up out my dream 'cause I ain't feel my drink with me
(Where the fuck my drink?)
Everybody with me slime, damn, yeah, I got snakes with me
(We got slime and we some snakes)"
Happy,"Wake up, the sun is shining bright,
The world’s a canvas, painted with light.
Every step we take, we’re dancing in the breeze,
Life’s a celebration, so come on, let’s seize!
"
Happy,"Chasing down the sunset, with a smile on our face,
We’re writing our own story, in this incredible place.
Life’s a grand adventure, let’s make it our own,
With hearts full of laughter, we’re never alone!"
Happy,"Let’s paint our skies with colors, every hue we can find,
With joy as our compass, and love as our guide.
No mountain’s too high, no dream’s out of sight,
We’re shining like the stars in the endless night."
Happy,"Feel the rhythm of the morning, hear the melody,
Every moment’s golden, every day’s a symphony.
Hearts are soaring high, like a kite in the blue,
The world is full of wonder, and it’s waiting just for you!"
Happy,"We’re cruising on a rainbow, chasing every dream,
Laughter’s in the air, and everything’s a gleam.
With every little heartbeat, we’re making magic real,
Together we’re unstoppable, and this is how we feel!"
Breakup,"I used to think forever was just a word we said,
Now the echoes of our promises are all that’s left unsaid.
Your shadows dance in the corners of my empty room,
Reminding me that love’s a fleeting, fragile bloom."
Breakup,"The stars we wished upon are falling from the sky,
And the promises we made just drifted by.
I’m chasing echoes of a love that’s turned to dust,
In a world where forever was never meant to be a must."
Breakup,"I kept your letters in a box beneath my bed,
Each one a testament to the love we thought we had.
Now I’m standing in the ruins of our dreams and our past,
Searching for a way to let go and move on at last."
Breakup,"Your laughter used to be my favorite song,
Now it’s just a haunting melody where I don’t belong.
We tried to rewrite our story with a broken pen,
And now I’m lost in the pages of what could have been."
Breakup,"We carved our names in the old oak tree,
But time’s cruel hands have turned that memory.
The dreams we built are ashes in the wind,
And I’m left here picking up the pieces of where we’d been."
