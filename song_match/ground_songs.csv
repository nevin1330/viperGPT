Violent,Switch it Up,"[Intro]
(Gold Haze on the track)

[Chorus: Pooh Shiesty]
Ayy, just sit back, see how I play it, Shiesty switched it up a notch
Let the dope cook on the stove, we turn the eye down, watch the pot
1017 'round my chain so I tote the same 'mount of shots
Palm Angels denim huggin' me, pockets keep growin' knots
And I ain't had shit when I got out, had to snake my way to the top
Left two men down, we got 'em shot, blrrrd, blrrrd, switch out the Glock
Mug around me, get you popped, I treat everybody like opps
We move with flip phones and pagers 'cause them iPhonеs get shit locked
My operation too major, I posе 'cause the feds watching

[Verse 1: Pooh Shiesty]
Buy firearms and narcotics, the first-degree boys and robberies
Had these rollin' Backwoods of them dead opps, I had to spark
Double cup filled up with Wocky, that medicine in my body
I signed a deal and went and bought a P, put the vacuum seals in my projects
You wanna order up a hundred, sixty bags of 'em was garbage
You know I'm slimy as it get, I got all way here off a noggin
And no, I can't put up my fire', that's a never, not even probably
Since a youngin, been shit poppin', since Truey joggers and Robins
We vaccine niggas for flossin', leave his head like Dennis Rodman's
When I pop out Richard Mille, bet they say Shiesty the hardest (Shiesty the hardest)
Besides rap, I was gettin' rich regardless
I got this shit forever tatted on me, king of of my apartments
Everybody keep on yappin' 'til them .62s get to sparkin'
Cut the block off, stop the traffic, if a car come through, this Drac' goin' park it

He tried to run off, I dumped the Draco where his spine at
7.62 god, I got that name because I'm firin' that

If I shoot my gun, three hundred shots gon' come behind it
And if I ever ran, the police probably was behind me
Bendin' corners, jumpin' fences, hittin' them gates, and now we lit
Who can't do a show up in the city? Bitch, this my shit

[Verse 1]
I'm slidin' with thirty, totin' a fifty, sent three shots and bagged him up
Ayy, you remember on that day, I shot so fast the fifty bust?
No, you can't be the gang, you know it's hard for us to gain some trust
You wanna be the gang, you gotta sacrifice your life to us
Now put a cap up on my head, no, I can't never go out bare
Think my shooters, they went deaf or somethin', 'cause all he do is stare
My name spread like the coronavirus, Shiesty in the air
Kick the bitch up out the spot, I caught her tryna leave her hair
Now put a cap up on my head, no, I can't never go out bare

Free my niggas from jail, if not, they might escape

Slimin' shit every day, bitch, we come from catchin' them plays

Everybody know how it go and seen bro on bro, on God, we ain't shootin' no ones
Baby got mills, I come through, foreign
Sell these bands if it ain't no tourin'
Fresh white tee and some Off-White Jordans
Trackhawk too loud, it don't need no horn
Keep my weed, I need my drugs
Got two chefs, gotta feed my son
Soon as my feet hear the screech, I run
Burn through weed every week, buy tons

If **** be late on payin' they dues this month, I'm gettin' 'em touched
If gangsters can't get into heaven, tell Meech that I said, ""What's up?""
They shot my first love in the skull, left her layin' in cold blood
Can't get no concrete evidence, hit everybody I think it was
Shit get killed like Scary Movie when I'm the one holdin' the grudge
**** got flipped, tried to spray it, tried to headshot with the judge, ah (Ah)
Dead dummy, what the fuck he thought this was?

Ayy, look, keep that right there like that
Keep, like, then try to clean it up and shit, I'm finna call right back

[Verse 3]
If he shot at you with a shiesty mask on, I'm probably who sent him (Blrrd)
Louis Forces and Chrome Heart denim, Goyard backpack, bandaids in 'em
Fuck with Poison, solid nigga, he just got trapped off in the system
Caught a body, stabbed a nigga, three life sentences, still say ""Free 'em"" (Blrrd, blrrd, blrrd)
Centerfolds is how I get busy
No more double taps on Insta
My DM turned to CorrLinks, folded my clothes to make a pillow
C.O. tried to blemish my image, always harassin' a nigga
What don't kill you make you bigger, I feel safer around here (Let's go)
Shiesty, I'm somethin' like a wizard, I turn boosters into killers
I turn all my opps to pictures, turn my Cartiers to Richards
Turn bad bitches into members, all my VS1s to emeralds
A Hellcat to German engine, I'm trained, do you hear the difference? (Blrrd)
Have you ever robbed a dealer? You ain't never killed no killer
F&N keep me fuck nigga free, I call this bitch ""GloRilla""
Nine million cash in the vault, give it to London if they seal me
Could be throwin' a mannequin challenge, bet this jewelry still gon' glisten
Fucked around, scratched up the 'Rari, rubbed my Cuban links on it
Five-time platinum off one hit, but I be still tryna take hits
I'm with some shit from Acres Homes, she Serena Williams thick
Off this nine, yeah, whole clip in, but this four-four I gotta get (Blrrd, blrrd)
Head huntin', I could press red buttons, I'm Memphis president
Brabus Benz, I climb in through the back like it's the ambulance
I'm rich as I ever been, I'm lit as I ever been
Good pussy my medicine
I get paid in full before the contract, ain't no more backends, yeah, yeah
Yeah, three golden rules, seven amendments, five Cubans, five pendants
My feet bleedin', I'm standin' on business
Had to clean up Rico brains when he had died up on that mission
Used to look at Tini like a sister 'til she said I did it
Must've forgot I was sittin' in that waitin' room all night with her mama
We don't talk reckless up on the jail phone, we use the corner
They locked me up for five winters, gotta shine to beat the summer
On bad terms with Scarr before he died, couldn't even say I love him
I found out through the C.O., he let me out, said, ""Call your mama""
Baby Shiesty think I be bitchin', I holler at him 'cause I love him
If I sit back and watch drugs kill you, I fail as a brother
Sobered up, I don't think they ready for the new me, they in trouble
Prada, K Carbon, she makin' CG look good while I struggle
In a warehouse full of lollipops, I'm allergic to suckers
Glizzy got a speech impediment, he don't do nothin' but stutter
Only sport I ain't good at is bowlin', I stay in the gutter
[Outro]
Not a pimp, but I'm somethin' like one, quick to send a renegade
All this shit I talk, I can't go like Lil Migo, ain't no way
But I might go out like 23, or like Nuski and Trey Day
My nigga ain't wanna get in the car with me, I was ridin' 'round with a grenade
I ain't no Blood, I ain't no Crip, I ain't no Muslim, kill them rumors
Try that shit on one of these other cappin' rappers, I'm a shooter
I don't join gangs, I make 'em, go read about me on Google
I say, I say, it's known I'm young, rich, and deadly
I say swing and they say step
Keep KD on thirty-seven, feel like I'm censored off a belly
Somebody tell Bill get ready, I heard Hennessy a nasty
Thinkin' out loud, I can't help it

Don't never question or worry about shit happening to me
Worry 'bout what I'ma do to a mothafucka

[Verse]
First time switchin' up the vent, I get versatile and all
I been fucked up, in my feelings, don't wan' talk, just playin' it off
Pay attention, shit hit different when you stuck behind that wall
But I don't regret it, sharpen my tool 'causе shit ain't go as I thought
Damn, they tryin' throw dirt on my legacy
Built like a mountain, you won't see mе fall
Twenty hoes naked, first dial, he called
Switch the location, I ain't goin' in raw
Play with my moves, no out of bounds
Speak to my bitch, thought she was lyin' every time she say she hold me down
Hard times, you gon' find out who really love you or your clout
In a fucked up situation you won't hear come out my mouth
Held my pain in long enough, this what I sound like, breakin' down
I got locked, niggas stopped doin' shit, they wouldn't if I was 'round
Like they happy I went federal, see what that hate about
I'ma make sure your fingers get cut off since you count me out
My granddaddy passed away the other day, I just found out
Shit crazy, rest in peace, you'll forever live through me, blrrrd, ayy
I'm goin' through too much smoke at once, prayin' to God can help me clear it
Standin' ten for Tee Da P, I know you watchin', can you hear me?
On the jail call with Ma Dukes, she say your name, my eyes get teary
Just keep callin' me my angels, that shit scary but I don't fear it
Step alone, my fallen soldiers all I need for my security
Don't hold grudges, I still love you
Just don't want you nowhere near me
In my cell, I'm tryna digest who really love and who fear me
Washin' my clothes in the sink, no more two thousand dollar Amiri jeans
Ask my cellie, AP, we up early, daily, pullin' schemes
My skin glowin' since I been sober, can't go back to sippin' lean
My mindset got different, I'm in prison before I'm sentenced
They don't even know the life I'm livin'
They tryna paint the pic of a menace
I need a second chance to get out
My opposer way too different
That's enough of all this sad shit
Let's go back to poppin', pimpin'
I can't never turn my back on none of my bitches from Memphis
Copped my country ho a stolo, bought my Brooklyn ho a Bentley
I was told, ""Get up and get it,"" ran up racks in the pandemic
Tryna get rich or die slimin', I touched millions off of rhymin'
Eight figure lil' spinnin' nigga, pull triggers and get excited
Niggas I thought was so loyal turned 6ix9ine in my indictment
I got morals 'fore I bite some cheese I’ll lay down and keep quiet
All my bitches send me nudes, they pass out mail, I get to smilin'
Got to laugh to keep from cryin', way too much shit on my shoulders
I thought I was movin' smart, this shit now make it more colder
Book me now get an arena, South Memphis baby went global
Want one-seven-five a show so ain't no more janky promoter
I pack my favorite cologne, this six thousand dollar odor
Need a drug, he don't spin sober, I can't buy the shit you sellin'
Fuck a co-d, I move solo, mission time, Shiesty get selfish
Only two kings out of Memphis I know of, that's me and Elvis
Glock [?] stay in my jumpsuit, poker keep scratchin' my pelvis
We shootin' dice for noodles, I went through your whole commissary, yeah, ayy
See, used to two slide on [?], blind as shit but now I see
I brought hip-hop back, the industry watered down without me
Dumb love for my nigga Smurk but I'm the real voice of the street
Don't condone in dyin' hair, wearin' purses and skinny jeans
Ayy, I'ma be back in a minute, won't be too long 'til I'm free, yeah
Ayy, won't be too long 'til I'm free, won't be too long 'til I'm free
Watch out, bro
I tried to drop some shit with Dolph and Gotti
Caught a nigga murked
Let Gucci squash shit with me and Kodak 'cause it wasn't even worth it
Hate that shit happened with Von, left me with two open verses

And all these doors that's locked, you hear me?
I heard niggas been gettin' bold
I heard niggas got balls now, niggas ain't hidin' no more
They think it's over wit' for me, it's o- okay, that's cool, though

But that's what you call pussy, I been knew all that love was fake
That's why I wasn't made up at all, I still got one foot on you niggas' necks
Y'all just could breathe a lil' bit now 'cause I'm away
But it gon' takes more than tomatoes to catch up with me, you hear me?
I ran up ten million in two years off tellin' my life story
And I got more power than money

I done been through more shit than a ninety-nine year old, though
I'm with y'all before you know it
I'm just takin' this shit one day at a time, all I do is smoke, eat and terrorize

The track is one of Rap Genius’ 30 most viewed songs, coming in with 1.8 million views.99. BIG KRIT ""REM""98. Lupe Fiasco ""Peace of paper/Cup of JAYZUS""97. Joey Badass ""#Longlivesteelo""96. Meek Mill ""Lil Nigga Snupe""95. Logic ""Nasty""Produced by DJ Don Cannon, this wordplay-heavy track puts Logic on display for all to see. None can ignore Def Jam’s latest signee; the double entendres are abundant and the flow hits code red. Serving as his first single of the year proved to be a successful venture, gaining tens of thousands of views on Rap Genius and creating a platform for his Young Sinatra: Welcome To Forever mixtape.94.

Domo Genesis ""Yu"" Domo Genesis constructs a catchy hook to bounce over Left Brain’s keyboard heavy production. The Odd Future duo of Domo and Hodgy Beats lay down dope bars with their usual uncensored subject matter of drugs, bitches and wolves!89. Mike WiLL Made It  ft. Miley Cyrus, Wiz Khalifa, & Juicy J ""23""88. Action Bronson ""Strictly For My Jeeps""87. Rapsody ft. Chance the Rapper ""Lonely Thoughts""86. Ab Soul ft. Mac Miller ""The End Is Near""85. DJ Khaled ft. Drake, Rick Ross, & Lil Wayne ""No New Friends""“No New Friends” was the first single off DJ Khaled's Suffering From Success album. Produced by Noah ""40"" Shebib, the track features the usual suspects: Drake, Rick Ross, and Lil Wayne. A behind-the-scenes photo from this song's video shoot led to the ultra-famous ‘Drake Lean’ meme, one of the biggest memes of 2013! With an enthralling beat and a memorable hook, “No New Friends” was one of the most anthemic tracks of the year.84. Danny Brown ft. A$AP Rocky ""Kush Coma""83. Rick Ross ft. Future ""No Games""82. Flatbush Zombies ""MRAZ""81. Wale ft. Sam Dew ""Love/Hate Thing""80. Vic Mensa ""Lovely Day""“Lovely Day” is just one of those songs that makes you want to get up and dance, because it’s so upbeat and fun! Vic lays down some dope bars, with metaphors that carry across multiple lines, a reference to Lupe’s “Daydreamin’”, and a shoutout to his best friend, what’s not to love about this track?79. Meek Mill ""Levels""78. Run The Jewels ""A Christmas Fucking Miracle""77. Lil Wayne ft. Drake & Future ""Love Me""76. Danny Brown ft. Freddie Gibbs ""The Return""75. 2 Chainz ""Used 2""This rare 2 Chainz solo joint has banging drums, an infectious hook, and a great club vibe. Produced by Mannie Fresh, the cut from B.O.A.T.S ll #METIME sees Tity Boi travel from Cali to New Orleans in the space of 2 bars, party the night away, and encourage more twerking. What isn’t there to like?74. Lil Wayne ft. 2 Chainz ""Rich As Fuck""73. Vic Mensa ft. Ab-Soul ""Holy, Holy""72. Tech N9ne ft. Serj Tankian ""Straight Out The Gate""71. ASAP Nast ft. Method Man ""Trillmatic""70. Kid Cudi ""Immortal""In an extremely personal ”Immortal”, Cudi details his inner struggles. Arguably the best song from Indicud, this track saw Cudi handle all duties, production included. The drums hit hard, the harmonizing is uplifting and the strings melt your ears. Even an Adam Sandler sample made its way into the joint!69. Tyler, the Creator ""48""68. Lil Wayne ft. Chance The Rapper ""You Song""67. Jhene Aiko ft. Childish Gambino ""Bed Peace""66. TI ft. B.o.B & Kendrick Lamar ""Memories Back Then""65. Mac Miller ft. Schoolboy Q ""Gees""This playful track is about nothing at all, so who better to kill it than Q and Mac? Mac lays down a characteristically hilarious hook and switches flows and voices as the bouncy beat from Chuck Inglish changes up. Q does his high-energy Q thing and blesses us with a nice ""FIGG SIDEEEEEEEE"" to wrap it all up.64. Lil B ""I Love You""63. Danny Brown ft. Purity Ring ""25 Bucks""62. Schoolboy Q ""Yay Yay""61. Wale ft. Tiara Thomas ""Bad""60. Lupe Fiasco ""SLR 2""The fan requested “Control” response brought out Super Lupe for the second time and he was none too happy with the game. He called out multiple rappers while seamlessly changing flows and displaying classic Lupe lyricism. Oh yeah, and he made the song in just two hours!59. Mac Miller ""Objects In The Mirror""58. Earl Sweatshirt ft. Tyler, the Creator ""Whoa""57. Childish Gambino ft. Chance the Rapper ""Worst Guys""56. 2 Chainz ft. Pharrell ""Feds Watching""55. Rich Homie Quan ""Type Of Way""One hit wonder or talented hit maker? That’s the question posed by Rich Homie Quan with his street anthem “Type of Way"". The song propelled the relatively unknown Atlanta native into the spotlight and a top 50 spot on Billboards Hot 100 after it was caught up by the streets and shared around the Internet - even Michigan State’s college football team is using it as their team anthem!54. Vic Mensa ""Orange Soda""53. Ace Hood ""Bugatti"" ft. Future & Rick Ross52. Run The Jewels ""Banana Clipper""51. YG ""My Nigga""50. Joey Bada$$ “Unorthodox”Joey & Primo take it back to the golden age on this boom bap-esque joint. The minimalist production fits Joey’s flow perfectly and enables his complex delivery and dope bars to shine. Functioning as the first single from “Summer Knights”, Joey drops some surprises; explaining his reasoning behind not signing a major record deal and that he does verses for free!49. Rocko “U.O.E.N.O (Black Hippy Remix)” ft. Ab Soul, Jay Rock, Kendrick Lamar & Schoolboy Q48. Tyler, the Creator “Answer”47. Joey Badass “'95 'Till Infinity”46. Hopsin “Hop Is Back”45. Isaiah Rashad “Shot U Down (Remix)” ft. Jay Rock & Schoolboy Q”TDE newcomer Isaiah Rashad’s best offering of 2013 came with this infectious hook laden remix of his original “I Shot U Down”. Featuring fellow TDE spitters Jay Rock & Schoolboy Q, the hard drums and longer verses propel the track to new heights. If it’s anything to go by, we could be looking at a future addition to the Black Hippy quartet.44. Childish Gambino “Sweatpants”43. Tech N9ne “Fragile” ft. Kendrick Lamar, Kendall Morgan & ¡MAYDAY! 42. Mac Miller “Red Dot Music” ft. Action Bronson41. Jay Z “Oceans” ft. Frank Ocean40. J Cole “Forbidden Fruit” ft. Kendrick LamarAnother collaboration between good friends J. Cole and Kendrick Lamar led to one of the top singles off of Cole's album ""Born Sinner"". While Kendrick does not deliver a verse on it, the hook he gives us still is soothing and paints the religious theme throughout the song. Cole delivers two solid verses, talking about religion, his inner struggle, and even saying why he dropped his album the same day as Kanye West. One more from Lil Cole!39. Pusha T “Hold On” ft. Rick Ross38. Schoolboy Q “Man Of The Year”37. Earl Sweatshirt “Sunday” ft. Frank Ocean36. Jay Z “FuckwithmeyouknowIgotit” ft. Rick Ross35. Tyler, the Creator “IFHY” ft. Pharrell WilliamsThis is truly Tyler at his finest. From his beat to his bars, this track showcases Tyler’s supreme artistic talent. Oh, and there’s THAT VIDEO! The talk-rap, slow flow is personal and poetic. He combines crooning with curses effortlessly and elevates the track in doing so. The beat builds like a film. He even directed his idol Pharrell’s angelic voice on the bridge, with a melody Tyler created himself. Sonically this track was standout, and then he made that video and this became undeniably next-level. 34. Jay Z “Tom Ford”33. J Cole “Crooked Smile” ft. TLC32. Kendrick Lamar “Bitch Don't Kill My Vibe Remix” ft. Jay Z31. Chance The Rapper “Acid Rain” 30. Childish Gambino “Telegraph Ave (Oakland)”Perhaps the universal favorite from the album, this is a dark, entrancing look at the compulsive and haunting power of our past loves/infatuations. Like The Boy driving down Telegraph Ave, we can spend our time retreading the same roads thinking about “what ifs” and reminiscing about things lost – sometimes alongside the people with whom we lost them. But unless we decide to do something about all those lost things – whether to try again, or to walk away for good – all that wandering isn’t going to do us any good. Using Lloyd’s “Oakland” literally in the song, Gambino cleverly plays both rapper and listener creating and experiencing the track with us.29. Tyler, the Creator “Rusty” ft. Domo Genesis & Earl Sweatshirt28. Chance The Rapper “Favorite Song” ft. Childish Gambino27. A$AP Ferg “Work (Remix)” ft. A$AP Rocky, French Montana, SchoolBoy Q & Trinidad James26. Pusha T “King Push” 25. Chance The Rapper “Juice”The first single off Acid Rap, Juice was one of the big breakthroughs this year for Chance. The first thing that catches your ears is Chance’s sing-songy, cartoony flow which you can’t help singing along to (some jumping around is mandatory). But listen closely, and you get Chancelor’s dope bars: dense, great-sounding internal rhymes and clever Chicago references. As you’re headbanging through the verse though, you’re hit with that absolutely HYPE chorus that is guaranteed to make you lose your shit. What you’re left with is one of the catchiest, most memorable songs of 2013 and a high point in the spectacular year Chance has had.24. Drake “Hold On We're Going Home” ft. Majid Jordan23. A$AP Ferg “Shabba” ft. A$AP Rocky22. J Cole “Let Nas Down”21. Eminem “Berzerk""20. Drake “Worst Behavior”This Nothing Was The Same stand-out combines Drizzy’s loud, arrogant hook with even more flexin’ in his verses. DJ Dahi delivers with gritty, bass-heavy production deceptively containing no sample. Like many tracks on NWTS, Drake’s flow and the beat changes up across the song -- he even confidently borrows flow and bars from Ma$e’s “Mo Money Mo Problems” anthem. The music video stars his actual dad and uncles and contains his worst skit to date. Even with lyrics that playfully reference his famous Hot 97 freestyle blunder and remind us of his Degrassi roots, Drake manages to make one of the hardest bangers of 2013. Just accept that you’ll never get the timing right for that initial “.......WORST!”19. Earl Sweatshirt “Hive” ft. Vince Staples & Casey VeggiesThe leaps and bounds of growth that Earl Sweatshirt has experienced over the last several years can really be heard on Doris' standout track, “Hive.” Fueled by a bassline that gives the song that dark, Odd Future feel, Earl spits much more mature bars using his now polished signature flow. With the addition of a great hook from young Casey Veggies, the song was already fantastic. But then Vince Staples busts in with a ski mask and absolutely kills it. Did Vince renegade Earl? That's up for debate, but you can't deny that Shyne, and everyone else on the song, absolutely did their thing.18. Eminem “Love Game” ft. Kendrick LamarWhen the MMLP2 tracklist was revealed, Love Game was one of the most heavily-anticipated tracks; everyone was envisioning a Renegade-level back-and-forth between Em and Kendrick. But the song turned out to be as left-field as possible. Backed by a quirky Rick Rubin-produced instrumental that could’ve come straight from the ‘50s (cheesy sample included), Eminem describes his time with an unfaithful woman in hilarious detail, while Kendrick emulates Em’s flow and raps about his experiences with the infamous Sherane. Although a largely comical song, Love Game still has a lot of great rhymes, with an especially phenomenal third verse by Em. Despite their bad experiences with women, Marshall and K.Dot let us know that they’re always going to be playing the game of love!17. Drake “Started From The Bottom”“Started From The Bottom”, produced by Mike Zombie, was the first single off Drake's Nothing Was The Same album. The track was released in February and peaked at #6 on the US Billboard Hot 100. It has since been certified 2x Platinum. Some may doubt if Drake really did ‘start at the bottom’, but with 2.2 million pageviews on Rap Genius and one of the catchiest hooks of the year, there is no doubt that this track was one of the biggest anthems of 2013.16. Childish Gambino “3005”The lead single for Because the Internet is quintessential Childish Gambino, but is also a great showcase for the artist’s development over the last two years. It’s a good sampling of the album’s overall sound and texture. Gambino paints a great picture of how, if you don’t have someone you really care about beside you, you can be completely alone in a crowded room, to say nothing of dealing with the rest of the shit life throws at you. He both raps and sings exceptionally well and effortlessly here. Gambino also gave us a pleasantly metaphorical video to accompany the song and make us think even more.15. Chance The Rapper “Cocoa Butter Kisses” ft. Vic Mensa & TwistaTwo generations of Chicago hip-hop converge on this mixtape cut, with one artist already garnering national attention introducing another to the scene and re-introducing an OG from his city. Vic steals the show with an urgent and unforgiving verse, and Chance happily cedes the spotlight to him, restraining himself to an unassumingly spry and sing-songy verse; Twista, on the other hand, is not quite so willing to take a back seat, successfuly lacing the track with his trademark double-time bars. But amidst the aggressively fast raps of the trio, the hook has a contrastingly soothing melody that rounds out the entire production. This track firmly announces that hip-hop is once again Chicagoan.14. Jay Z “Holy Grail” ft. Justin TimberlakeIn a year of nervy choices that made business headlines around the world, Jay Z's boldest decision was actually a musical one. The only voice you hear during the first 1:19 of his new album's leadoff track is not Hov, but rather Justin Timberlake. This only manages to build anticipation, so that we are well-primed for the rapper's entry.And what an entry it is. His daughter's name is literally the first word out of his mouth, and with good reason. A post-fatherhood Jay is contemplative about the ups and downs of a personified fame, while admitting ultimately that he can't leave it alone. And lest we think he's lost a step, his patented wordplay is in full effect, with a pun on ""pigeons"" that puts today's coke-rappers to shame.13. ASAP Rocky “1 Train” ft. Kendrick Lamar, Joey Badass, Yelawolf, Danny Brown, Action Bronson and Big K.R.I.T.""1 Train"" is the cypher to end all cyphers. A$AP Rocky amalgamated a line-up without a single weak spitter, and they all did their worst to this Hit-Boy produced banger. It's impossible to pick who delivered the best verse here: was it the energized Danny Brown? the lovable braggart Action Bronson? the wordsmith Joey Bad? the hard-driving Big K.R.I.T.? Someone else? I can't decide, but I do know this: the track is flames12. Schoolboy Q “Collard Greens” Kendrick LamarA cut between two of Top Dawg Entertainment's main artists, Schoolboy Q and Kendrick Lamar came in to make a party banger just in time for summer. Schoolboy Q delivers a solid verse about his favorite things, (and how other people can't have them), before Kendrick comes in with that Español that makes this verse so memorable. The hook might be a little random, but the vibe it generates makes it infectious upon first listen.11. Kanye West “ Black Skinhead”When word dropped that Daft Punk would be working with Kanye West on his new album, it was fair to assume it would result in a genre-blending song like Stronger. What we ended up with was indeed a blend of genres, but instead of electronic synths and filtered vocals, we got primal screams and distorted 808’s. Kanye is pissed off, but not the kind of pissed he gets about croissants or Jimmy Kimmel. No, Ye is fed up with people questioning his choices and he’s frustrated that nobody is taking risks anymore. And it’s palpable in this song, which represents the rebellious, IDGAF attitude that flows from both Kanye and Yeezus. Using few else but drums and vocal sounds you’d more likely hear exploring the Amazon than in Hip Hop, Kanye crafts an uneasy, raw instrumental that pairs perfectly with his blunt lyrics10. J Cole “Power Trip” ft. MiguelIn classic J. Cole fashion, nearly everything on this track is done by himself. The smooth voice of Miguel helps out on a hook, but otherwise it is Cole’s world. The incredibly catchy hooks match up perfectly with his production and he drops plenty of relatable bars about a crush. This continuation of his 2009 song “Dreams” is about not only a girl, but also hip-hop and its impact on him - giving an already impressive song some duality. And much like the song sounds, its video felt like a short film as Cole literally does whatever it takes to claim his love. The 10th most viewed song on RG in 2013, fans spent a combined 7.5 years of time on this song page!09. Drake “Pound Cake/Paris Morton Music 2” ft. Jay ZDrake crafts one of the most memorable tracks of 2013 with the outro to his third studio LP Nothing Was The Same. Boi-1da delivers on Pound Cake with a spacey Ellie Goulding sample as Drizzy paints the picture about what his life has been like while recording and making the album.The song isn’t finished there by any means. After two Jay verses, Drake comes back in for Paris Morton Music 2 and a perfect verse to remind us this is his song. The extra long PMM 2 verse is also very personal, looking back on the landscape of  his career and perhaps how he’s no longer the same08. Pusha T “Numbers On The Boards”My Name Is My Name is a stark minimalist creation and with the “No Artwork” cover, “Numbers On The Boards” is the centerpiece. Don Cannon & Kanye West create the spine with King Push on his super Lupe raps in between catchy samples. Push said all year he wanted to bring “that feeling back”, and “Numbers On The Boards” knocks harder than him thumping the wall with his fist. The lyrically enthralling track is jam packed with references and double entendres that takes you to Pusha’s dark underground hell in only a way he could.07. “Kanye West - Bound 2” ft. Charlie Wilson“Bound 2” was an unexpected but wholly welcome ending to Yeezus. The song has sparked wide discussion: is it a rejection of the past 37 minutes? Is it a reassurance to fans about Kanye’s present musical identity? Is it a revelation about Kanye’s future? Who really cares? Kanye fans who hated Yeezus loved it and Kanye fans who loved Yeezus loved it. “Bound 2” is a weirdly endearing love song featuring classic Kanye flow floating over soul samples, topped with Charlie Wilson’s magical voice. What’s not to like?! Well, many would actually say “the video”, which was an overtly cheesy, green-screened, steamy motorcycle ride that not only made the world cringe, but also felt like the furthest thing from Ye’s aesthetic. But that was the point. Ye geniusly defied our expectations and used his prettiest song’s video as a commentary on the “wack” quality of American art and media that he feels should be banned. How very, New Slaves of him.06. Eminem “Bad Guy”Sequels to much-loved properties are rarely a good idea. For every The Empire Strikes Back, there are three Matrix Reloadeds.  So when word leaked out that Em had recorded a follow-up to his epic 2000 story-song “Stan,” fans were nervous.  After all, Stan died at the end, right? So what’s left?Plenty, as it turns out.  Marshall turned a potentially bad idea into fantastic art with his imagining of Stan’s little brother Matthew (with the autographed Starter cap), now all grown up and seeking revenge.  But just as the tale reaches its apex, the song switches perspective, revealing an intense look at Eminem’s self-doubts and anguish. Just before the end, he drops the biggest gem of all: his in-song tormentors are “just symbolic/Of not knowing what you had ‘til it’s gone.”  The rapper himself may not know, but trust us, Slim, we do.05. Pusha T “Nosetalgia” ft. Kendrick LamarThis genre defining song starts with a dirty Nottz beat that makes you feel like committing a crime and quickly escalates to the feeling you’re part of one. The KRS sample serves as the hook and sounds of scratches fill the airwaves. Kings Push & Kendrick come through with menacing delivery and complex wordplay. While Terrence is neck deep in dealing, Kendrick is in the midst of consumption - the contrast is phenomenal, both MC’s affected by the crack epidemic in opposing instances. The insight into Kendrick’s story is rare, the Compton native always let us ride around his house but never let us through the front door. “Nosetalgia” is your 8ball on a Friday night, 4 shots of espresso every morning, and the In N Out double double you crave in LA. It’s dope. 04. Kanye West “Blood On The Leaves”Blood On The Leaves introduces a new piece into the emotional puzzle of Yeezus: remorse. The song is drowning in so many feels, it’s impossible not to catch some yourself. Kanye’s autotuned story of sadness begins atop the somber piano of the beautifully chopped Strange Fruit sample, but then the blaring horns and bass of TNGHT’s R U Ready burst through and all of a sudden that sadness turns to rage. By the end of it all you’re left with a modern day power ballad with enough autotune and raw emotion to make Future blush. Blood On The Leaves got to a bit of a slow start on Rap Genius due to lack of exposure pre-album release, but thanks in part to Kanye’s emotionally charged VMA performance the song is one of the most viewed Yeezus tracks on the site. The song’s instrumental has also become one of Producer Genius’ prized breakdowns, explaining the use of the song’s controversial Nina Simone sample and the origin of that beat drop. Can you imagine if Yeezus started off with this song, like Kanye originally planned? The world would have imploded.03. Eminem “Rap God””Six minutes, Slim Shady, you’re on”. After the novelty of a second Marshall Mathers LP began to wear off, Eminem got the buzz back by becoming the third MC this year to proclaim himself a god. This rapid-fire lyrical tour de force is laced with references to the first Mathers LP, sneak disses to some of his old buddies, and a 17 second stretch crammed with over 100 words. The Detroit native also broke Rap Genius the day ""Rap God"" was released, and has now amassed over 4 million page views

Proving himself in the booth was just the beginning for Slim. After criticism he lip synced on live television, Marshall Mathers showed up to the YouTube music awards and destroyed the hopes and dreams of every rapper alive when he performed the song live. It’s safe to say ""Rap God"" proved the internal rhyme mastermind is back on his Pharoahe Monch grind and nothing’s going to stop him.02. Big Sean “Control” ft. Kendrick Lamar & Jay ElectronicaYou all knew this was coming. Big Sean delivered a 3 minute dope verse to open the track. Comparing his rapping skill to a baby's first steps and reminiscing on his grandfather, he manages to give one of the best verses of his career. For obvious reasons, we'll skip to Jay Electronica next. He too spit a clean verse about religion, while sneaking in TV and car references, and even mentioning his late grandmother, much like Sean did.However, there was a 3rd feature to this monster track produced by No I.D. His name? King Kendrick Lamar. He came with one purpose: to assassinate the competition. The lyrical warfare was on for all to see and was full of levels. The Compton MC proclaimed he was both 2Pac's offspring and the King of New York, causing mass hysteria in hip hop’s homeland. But oh no, it wasn’t over yet. His braggadocio left mouths agape as he goes on to say he is as popular as the Beatles and placed his name up for one of the greatest MC's of all time. And yet there was more...he called out every hot young rapper - by their name, a rarity in Hip Hop (no sneak disses here!). Basically Kendrick manages to piss off every rapper and revolutionize the rap game at the same damn time. How about it?01. Kanye West “New Slaves” ft. Frank Ocean""New Slaves"" is best described as an “open letter” from Kanye West to the people - made into music. Produced by the Very G.O.O.D Beats crew, New Slaves is sonically simplistic yet still possesses melody courtesy of the droning synths. Frank Ocean assists on the outro, providing an amazing contrast to the aggressive tone used throughout the song, acting in a reflective manner. However from a lyrical standpoint it’s without a doubt one of Kanye’s greatest songs. He labeled verse 2 as the “best verse of all time” and with topics that range from modern day slavery to the fashion industry, and even America's prison system, it’s hard to disagree

The Chi-town native doesn’t just stop at the music. With a guerrilla marketing scheme fit for a military coup, Ye projected the track onto buildings in 66 locations across the world. It’s been 8 months since the song’s release and the significance of ”New Slaves is only just surfacing. Between the time of the song’s release and present day, the attitude of multiple industries has started to shift dramatically - would Jay Z and Beyonce have released projects with such unorthodox promotion methods if Kanye didn’t do it first? His movement, spearheaded with this peoples anthem, was made to inspire others to think in a similar light. ”New Slaves” invokes the power of free speech and brandishing the truth like an axe, Kanye challenges listeners to think outside the MatrixJust as Mandela blew up the buildings and eventually became president. Contrary to popular opinion, sometimes you have to blow up the building.— Kanye West578Embed","asty""Produced by DJ Don Cannon, this wordplay-heavy track puts Logic on display for all to see.

You're movin' just like a degenerate, every antic is feelin' distasteful
I calculate you're not as calculated, I can even predict your angle
Fabricatin' stories on the family front 'cause you heard Mr. Morale

The very first time I shot me a Drac', the homie had told me to aim it this way
I didn't point down enough, today, I'll show you I learned from those mistakes
Somebody had told me that you got a ring, on God, I'm ready to double the wage
I'd rather do that than let a Canadian nigga make Pac turn in his grave
Cutthroat business, you got shit twisted
What is it? The braids?
I hurt your feelings? You don't wanna work with me no more? Okay
It's three GOATs left, and I seen two of them kissin' and huggin' on stage
I love 'em to death, and in eight bars, I'll explain that phrase, huh
It's nothin' nobody can tell me, huh
I don't wanna talk on no celly, huh
You know I got language barriers, huh
It's no accent you can sell me, huh
Yeah, Cole and Aubrey know I'm a selfish nigga, the crown is heavy, huh
I pray they my real friends, if not, I'm YNW Melly
I don't like you poppin' shit at Pharrell, for him, I inherit the beef
Yeah, fuck all that pushin' P, let me see you push a T
You better off spinnin' again on him, you think about pushin' me
He's Terrence Thornton, I'm Terence Crawford, yeah, I'm whoopin' feet
We ain't gotta get personal, this a friendly fade, you should keep it that way
I know some shit about niggas that make Gunna Wunna look like a saint
This ain't been about critics, not about gimmicks, not about who the greatest
It's always been about love and hate, now let me say I'm the biggest hater
I hate the way that you walk, the way that you talk, I hate the way that you dress
I hate the way that you sneak diss, if I catch flight, it's gon' be direct
We hate the bitches you fuck 'cause they confuse themself with real women
And notice, I said ""we,"" it's not just me, I'm what the culture feelin'
How many more fairytale stories 'bout your life 'til we had enough?
How many more Black features 'til you finally feel that you're Black enough?
I like Drake with the melodies, I don't like Drake when he act tough
You gon' make a nigga bring back Puff, let me see if Chubbs really crash somethin'
Yeah, my first one like my last one, it's a classic, you don't have one
Let your core audience stomach that, then tell 'em where you get your abs from
V12, it's a fast one, baow-baow-baow, last one
Headshot for the year, you better walk around like Daft Punk
[Verse 2]
Remember?
Ayy, Top Dawg, who the fuck they think they playin' with?
Extortion my middle name as soon as you jump off of that plane, bitch
I'm allergic to the lame shit, only you like bein' famous
Yachty can't give you no swag neither, I don't give a fuck 'bout who you hang with
I hate the way that you walk, the way that you talk, I hate the way that you dress
Surprised you wanted that feature request, you know that we got some shit to address
I even hate when you say the word ""nigga,"" but that's just me, I guess
Some shit just cringeworthy, it ain't even gotta be deep, I guess
Still love when you see success, everything with me is blessed
Keep makin' me dance, wavin' my hand, and it won't be no threat
I'm knowin' they call you The Boy, but where is a man? 'Cause I ain't seen him yet
Matter fact, I ain't even bleed him yet, can I bleed him? (Bet)
When I see you stand by Sexyy Red, I believe you see two bad bitches
I believe you don't like women, it's real competition, you might pop ass with 'em
Let's speak on percentage, show me your splits, I'll make sure I double back with ya
You were signed to a nigga that's signed to a nigga that said he was signed to that nigga
Try cease and desist on the ""Like That"" record?
Ho, what? You ain't like that record?
""Back To Back,"" I like that record
I'ma get back to that, for the record
Why would I call around tryna get dirt on niggas? Y'all think all my life is rap?
That's ho shit, I got a son to raise, but I can see you don't know nothin' 'bout that
Wakin' him up, know nothin' 'bout that
Then tell him to pray, know nothin' 'bout that
Then givin' him tools to walk through life like day by day, know nothin' 'bout that
Teachin' him morals, integrity, discipline, listen, man, you don't know nothin' 'bout that
Speakin' the truth and consider what God's considerin', you don't know nothin' 'bout that
Ain't twenty-v-one, it's one-v-twenty if I gotta smack niggas that write with you
Yeah, bring 'em out too, I'll clean 'em out too, tell BEAM that he better stay right with you
Am I battlin' ghost or AI?
Nigga feelin' like Joel Osteen
Funny, he was in a film called A.I.
And my sixth sense tellin' me to off him
I'ma blick niggas all in they coffin
Yeah, OV-ho niggas is dick riders
Tell 'em run to America, they imitate heritage, they can't imitate this violence
What I learned is niggas don't like the West Coast, and I'm fine with it, I'll push the line with it
Pick a nigga off one at a time with it
We can be on a three-hour time difference
Don't speak on the family, crodie
It can get deep in the family, crodie
Talk about me and my family, crodie?
Someone gon' bleed in your family, crodie
I be at New Ho King eatin' fried rice with a dip sauce and a blammy, crodie
Tell me you're cheesin', fam
We can do this right now on the camera, crodie
Ayy, fuck y'all niggas, I don't trust y'all niggas
I wave one finger and thump y'all niggas like mmm

Upbeat,Can’t Handle This,"[Part I]

[Intro]
I went to Kanye West's recent tour, the Yeezus Tour
It was a big, dramatic, theatrical show
He did something very strange at the end of his show
Where he ranted for like 20 minutes
It was kind of a rant, kind of a song
He had auto-tune on his voice
And there was an instrumental in the background
Like this instrumental
He talked about his problems
Race, power; his $90 T-shirts weren't selling very well—that was most of it
And I watched this, I thought maybe I could do this
I'll be honest, my problems are not as high-stakes as Kanye's, but I have problems
And maybe a crowd in New York would be nice enough to indulge me
So as we get to the end of a night of theater, and comedy, and sweaters coming on and off
I got one question for you, and that question is...

[Verse 1]
Can I say my shit?
New York, can I say my shit?
I've got lots of shit to say
I've got lots of shit to say
Ooh, ooh-ooh
I can't fit my hand inside a Pringle can
I have a huge amount of trouble fitting my hand inside of a Pringle can
I can get my hand like four inches into the can
But then, I have to tilt the can into my mouth
But by that point, a bunch of crumbs have accumulated at the bottom of the can
So they all go spilling onto my face
What I'm trying to say is the diameter of Pringle cans is way too small
I'll say it again
The diameter of Pringle cans is way too small
Two radiuses of a Pringle can is way too small
If you feel me, put your hands up, come on!
If you feel me, put your hands up
Look at all these hands that are way too big to fit inside a Pringle can
Your hands are too big to fit inside of Pringle cans
Your hands are too big to fit inside of Pringle cans
You think you can, I know you can't, you think you can
Pringles! Listen to the people!
I am sure ninety percent of the complaint letters you get are about the width of your cans
Just make them wider
I've overdone the Pringles thing, sorry

I wanna have a daughter
Wanna have a daughter
So I can finally have someone around the house who can fit their hands in a Pringle can—yes, I'm still on the Pringle cans thing! Yeah!
I'll—I'll move on, alright?
But that is priority número uno
I don't go to the gym, 'cause I'm self-conscious about my body
But I'm self-conscious about my body 'cause I don't go to the gym
Irony can be so painful
That's a Catch-22, ooh, ooh-ooh
Let's do this!
I went to Chipotle
Went to Chipotle
Got myself a chicken burrito, brrap
I went down the line, I got like all these ingredients
And then, at the end of the line, the guy tried to wrap the burrito
But half of the shit inside the burrito spilled out, and he still wrapped it
I was like, ""Dude, you should have warned me!""
You're a burrito expert; you should have told me halfway through—
""Hey, man, you might be reaching maximum burrito capacity here""
Do you think I want a messy burrito?
No one wants a messy burrito
The whole appeal of a burrito is that all of the ingredients are contained within the confines of the tortilla
I wouldn't have gotten half this shit if I knew it wasn't gonna fit in the burrito!
Alright? Look
[Pre-Chorus]
I wouldn't have got the lettuce if I knew it wouldn't fit
Wouldn't have got the cheese if I knew it wouldn't fit
Wouldn't have got the peppers if I knew they wouldn't fit
I wouldn't have got half of it
Like, I'm okay with small mistakes
If you've got no more chicken, I'll take pork
But I'll blow my dad before I eat a burrito with a fork

[Chorus]
Wouldn't have got the lettuce if I knew it wouldn't fit
Wouldn't have got the cheese if I knew it wouldn't fit
Wouldn't have got the peppers if I knew they wouldn't—
Man, I wouldn't have got half of it, like
Half of it like, half of it like
Half of it like, half of it right now
I think it's time I, think it's time, that we break it down
[Part II]

[Interlude]
Ooh
Whoa, whoa
Whoa
Bl-l-l-l-l-l
(Put the lotion in the basket)
[Verse 3]
I can sit here and pretend like my biggest problems are
Pringle cans
And burritos
The truth is my biggest problem's you
I want to please you
But I want to stay true to myself
I want to give you the night out that you deserve
But I want to say what I think and not care what you think about it
A part of me loves you
Part of me hates you
Part of me needs you
Part of me fears you
And I don't think that I can handle this right now
Handle this right now
I don't think that I can handle this right now
I don't think that I can handle this right—
I don't think that I can handle this right—
I don't think that I can handle this right—
Look at them; they're just staring at me, like
""Come and watch the skinny kid with the steadily declining mental health
And laugh as he attempts to give you what he cannot give himself""
Think that I can handle this right—
I don't think that I can handle this right—
They don't even know the half of this, right—
They don't even know the half of it
But I know I'm not a doctor
I'm a pussy, I put on a silly show
I should probably just shut up and do my job
So here I go

[Chorus]
Wouldn't have got the lettuce if I knew it wouldn't fit
Wouldn't have got the cheese if I knew it wouldn't fit
Wouldn't have got the peppers if I knew they wouldn't fit
Wouldn't have got half—
You can tell them anything
If you just make it funny, make it rhyme
And if they still don't understand you
Then you run it one more time
Think that I can handle this right— HO!
Handle this right— HO!
Handle this right
Andu don't even know the half of this right now
Right now
HAH!
Now
Handle this right, handle this right
Handle this right now

My pen'll go off when I half-cock it
Got a fat knot from that rap profit
Made a livin' and a killin' off it

I'll still be able to break a motherfuckin' table
Over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half
Only realized it was ironic, I was signed to Aftermath after the fact
How could I not blow? All I do is drop F-bombs

Lakim Shabazz, 2Pac, N.W.A, Cube, hey Doc, Ren
Yella, Eazy, thank you, they got Slim
Inspired enough to one day grow up, blow up and be in a position
To meet Run–D.M.C., and induct them

Even though I'll walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames
Only Hall of Fame I'll be inducted in is the alcohol of fame
On the wall of shame

Off a plank and, tell me what in the fuck are you thinkin'?

Immediately with these bombs I'm totin'
And I should not be woken

But I got your mom deep-throatin'
I'm out my Ramen Noodle
We have nothin' in common, poodle
I'm a Doberman, pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage, pupil
It's me, my honesty's brutal
But it's honestly futile if I don't utilize what I do though
For good at least once in a while
So I wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle enough rhymes
To maybe try to help get some people through tough times
But I gotta keep a few punchlines
Just in case 'cause even you unsigned
Rappers are hungry lookin' at me like it's lunchtime
I know there was a time where once I
Was king of the underground
But I still rap like I'm on my Pharoahe Monch grind
So I crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine
Appeal with the skin color of mine
You get too big and here they come tryin'
To censor you like that one line
I said on ""I'm Back"" from The Mathers LP 1 when I
Tried to say I'll take seven kids from Columbine
Put 'em all in a line, add an AK-47, a revolver and a 9
See if I get away with it now that I ain't as big as I was, but I'm
Morphin' into an immortal, comin' through the portal
You're stuck in a time warp from 2004 though
And I don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for
You're pointless as Rapunzel with fuckin' cornrows
You write normal? Fuck being normal!
And I just bought a new raygun from the future
Just to come and shoot ya, like when Fabolous made Ray J mad
'Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Mayweather's pad
Singin' to a man while he played piano
Man, oh man, that was a 24/7 special on the cable channel
So Ray J went straight to the radio station
The very next day, ""Hey Fab, I'ma kill you!""
Lyrics comin' at you at supersonic speed (J.J. Fad)
Uh, summa-lumma, dooma-lumma, you assumin' I'm a human
What I gotta do to get it through to you? I'm superhuman
Innovative and I'm made of rubber so that anything you say is ricochetin' off of me and it'll glue to you and
I'm devastating, more than ever demonstrating
How to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating
Never fading, and I know the haters are forever waiting
For the day that they can say I fell off, they'll be celebrating
'Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated
I make elevating music, you make elevator music
""Oh, he's too mainstream.""
Well, that's what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it
""It's not hip-hop, it's pop,""—'cause I found a hella way to fuse it
With rock, shock rap with Doc
Throw on ""Lose Yourself"" and make 'em lose it
""I don't know how to make songs like that
I don't know what words to use.""
Let me know when it occurs to you
While I'm rippin' any one of these verses that versus you
It's curtains, I'm inadvertently hurtin' you
How many verses I gotta murder to
Prove that if you were half as nice, your songs you could sacrifice virgins too?!
Ugh, school flunky, pill junkie
But look at the accolades these skills brung me
Full of myself, but still hungry
I bully myself 'cause I make me do what I put my mind to
And I'm a million leagues above you
Ill when I speak in tongues, but it's still tongue-in-cheek, fuck you
I'm drunk, so, Satan, take the fucking wheel
I'ma sleep in the front seat
Bumpin' Heavy D and the Boyz, still ""Chunky but Funky""
But in my head there's something I can feel tugging and struggling
Angels fight with devils and here's what they want from me
They're askin' me to eliminate some of the women hate
But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred
I have, then you may be a little patient
And more sympathetic to the situation
And understand the discrimination
But fuck it, life's handin' you lemons? Make lemonade then!
But if I can't batter the women
How the fuck am I supposed to bake 'em a cake then?
Don't mistake him for Satan
It's a fatal mistake if you think I need to be overseas and take a vacation
To trip a broad, and make her fall on her face and
Don't be a retard—be a king? Think not
Why be a king when you can be a god?6.8KEmbed","ppin' any one of these verses that versus you

Once again, I find myself with my friends
Dancin' the night away, it's like the party never ends
Then again we don't want it to stop
'Cause tonight's the night
It goes sweatbox, laser beams, flashin' lights
Wild cards, men from Mars, dressed in stars and stripes
(Eclectic electric, ladies of the evenin', drinkin' booze and minglin')
Mashin' to the music, I can do anything
Freaky dicky star speckles and pink butterflies
And life is nice, so nice
I walk into a club and I've found paradise
I'm seein' stars, I can't believe my eyes (I'm seein' stars)

So while you fill the streets, it's appealing to see
And you won't get out the county 'cause you're damned and free
You got a new horizon, its ephemeral style
A melancholy town where we never smile
And all I wanna hear is the message beep
My dreams, they've got to kiss me 'cause I don't get to sleep, no

I remember way back when
I felt only ennui
Like nothing could complete me

Especially when he sees her
Pretty soon, he'll tease her

My laboured love bore only song
And not one of them a keeper

Relaxing,This Is My Dinner,"Arrived last night to the dark city of Oslo
Along the highway to the hotel, Ben pointed out the snow
I stepped outside, and the cold air pinched my nose
I recalled the many times I’ve come here before to play shows in Oslo
And in all of those times there are so many positive associations
Even playing the So What Club with my old band, the Red House Painters
And my times playing here solo acoustic
There was always a tall redheaded guy following me around
The King of Convenience

And I remember taking off from the venue with a blonde
And her boyfriend came knocking on the back door
Out for my blood
And she sent me out the front door fast
And I went running down the cold street
Watching over my shoulder, my heart was pounding fast
I was worried for my life
And I was young and I was single and I have no regrets about it
When you're in your twenties, in my opinion, nothing should be off limit
I don't really know what her boyfriend's problem even was
It's not like something threatening was going on
She was just jerkin' me off while I watched her suck my thumb

The most memorable drive I ever had in my life was from Bergen to Oslo
There were no signs of life
Now and then, just a single bird or a boat
And the ominous silver-black mountains
Off in the distance along the water
And in that moment I knew why Norway had the market on black metal
I’m pretty sure the movie Trolls was filmed in that area, from what I can remember
But its scenic beauty could never be captured in pictures
Every time I play in Norway, it's been a special time
I played all the cities in Norway
Not just Bergen and Oslo, but also Trondheim
Actually, there are a few that I don’t love that much if you'll allow me to be candid
The city of Tønsberg and the city of Stavanger
Too many dudes with their eyes glued to their phones
I remember telling them the importance of relationships
But it seemed low on their priority lists
You might also likeMy worst memory of Norway was playing a festival in Giske
I got a call that my cat lost her ability to walk
And she was very sick
And I loved that cat more than anything in the world
She shared my bed with me for sixteen years
She was my little baby girl
So I booked a flight out of the island of Giske
With hopes of getting home in time to see my kitty cat
Before she took her last breath
The whole thing was so upsetting
And the anxiety was building up so badly on the plane
And I kept writing in my journal, “Please Pink, don't die on me
Please Pink don't die on me
Please Pink don't die on me when I'm up there in the sky
I'll hate myself forever if I could not kiss you goodbye”
But she waited for me, when I got to my house
She was laying there lifeless on the couch
I told her how much she meant to me, and all the joy she had given me
If there's a god up there, I pray to him that she heard me

And of course, how could I forget my visits to dreamlike Ålesund
Everyone asks me, “Mark, who’s the girl in the song?”
She knows who she is, and to reveal it would spoil it
Leave the song alone, don't ask questions about it
Leave the song alone, make your own connections with it
Leave the song alone, don't ever try to overanalyze it
Leave the song alone, don't dissect it like a dead frog
Leave the song alone

I got a lot of friends in Norway
And I have to say my heart was broken when I heard about the guy who bombed Oslo
And killed the little children on their summer vacation
People in America complained about his sentence being so light
But this shit happens every week in my country
So your country is doing something right
I hate to bring this subject up
‘Cause it causes my stomach to get sick and uptight
My point is that Norway is peaceful
And you’re doing something right
I love so many things about Norway, and how they do Christmas right
The candelabra in the window, it's so subtle at night
When I tell Scandinavians how good they've got it
They just roll their eyes and say
“But it’s so dark through the winter and it gets very depressing”

I'm gonna tell you something, Norway, and this is no lie
I've traveled all around the world and Norwegians have the most beautiful eyes
The only thing I know that had more beautiful eyes than you
Was my precious little cat, her eyes were green and blue
I miss you to death, but I want to thank promoter Bernt Jacobs
My friend from Norway
He's a caring and very thoughtful person
He’s the one who arranged the flight to San Francisco for me
Out of the island of Giske
So I could get home and see my cat and give her one last kiss
And I even remember a time when I played this exact same venue
Some guy in the back seat got up and shouted
“Mark, I got something to tell you”
I said, “Okay, what is it?” and he said, “I hate your fucking guts”
And he rushed off in a huff
I told him, “When you leave and you’re crossing the street, I hope you get hit by a bus”
You gotta understand, he insulted me first
And on tour, I don't sleep much
You gotta understand what I said, that was not me
We all have our moments and that guy was sniffing glue
And I was high on sleep deprivation
Anyhow, I'm over it, I love you all and that's no lie
Of all the countries I've played
Yours is the most organized

And the fjords are so beautiful and the salmon melts in your mouth
And the girls are so stunning
Even the three I met in Stavanger, down south
There is one I'll never forget, how could I not remember?
She promoted my show and she showed me a Snickers bar
And she said, “I’m so fucking broke, this is my dinner""
I said, “If you like, I could give you a few hundred of my Norwegian kroner”
She said, “No ethically, I couldn’t take your money, Mark”
And that was the last time that I ever saw her

And my very favorite memory of Norway was playing the Garage in Bergen
There was an old man running the place named Dennis and we got to talking
He had a contagious smile
And we shared a bottle of sparkling water and a loaf of bread
It really wasn't much of a conversation
It was more like a one-sided monologue from Dennis
And I listened very close

Relaxing,Mystery of Love,"[Verse 1]
Oh, to see without my eyes
The first time that you kissed me
Boundless by the time I cried
I built your walls around me
White noise, what an awful sound
Fumbling by Rogue River
Feel my feet above the ground
Hand of God, deliver me

Oh, oh woe-oh-woah is me
The first time that you touched me
Oh, will wonders ever cease?
Blessed be the mystery of love

Lord, I no longer believe
Drowned in living waters
Cursed by the love that I received
From my brother's daughter
Like Hephaestion, who died

Brace yourself, I'll take you on a trip down memory lane
This is not a rap on how I'm slingin' crack or move cocaine
This is cul-de-sac and plenty Cognac and major pain
Not the drill sergeant, but the stress that weighin' on your brain
It was me, L Boog, and Yan Yan, YG Lucky ride down Rosecrans
It got ugly, wavin' yo' hand out the window — check yourself
Uh, Warriors and Conans, hope euphoria can slow dance
With society, the driver seat, the first one to get killed
Seen a light-skinned nigga with his brains blown out
At the same burger stand where **** hang out
Now, this is not a tape recorder sayin' that he did it
But ever since that day, I was lookin' at him different
That was back when I was nine, Joey packed the nine
Pakistan on every porch is fine,we adapt to crime
Pack a van with four guns at a time
With the sliding door, fuck is up?
Fuck you shootin' for if you ain't walkin' up, you fuckin' punk?
Pickin' up the fuckin' pump, pickin' off you suckers
Suck a dick or die or sucker punch
A wall of bullets comin' from AK's, AR's,""Ayy, y'all—duck""
That's what mama said when we was eatin' that free lunch
Aw man, goddamn, all hell broke loose
You killed my cousin back in '94, fuck yo' truce
Now crawl your head in that noose
You wind up dead on the news
Ain't no peace treaty, just piecin' BGs up to pre-approve
Bodies on top of bodies, IVs on top of IVs
Obviously the coroner between the sheets like the Isleys
When you hop on that trolley, make sure your color's correct
Make sure you're corporate, or they'll be callin' your mother collect
They say the governor collect all of our taxes, except
When we in traffic and tragic happens, that shit ain't no threat

Fresh outta school 'cause I was a high school grad'
Sleepin' in the living room of my mama's pad
Reality struck, I seen the white car crash
Hit the light pole, two niggas hopped out on foot and dashed (Watch out, cuz)
My pops said I needed a job, I thought I believed him
Security guard for a month and ended up leavin'
In fact, I got fired 'cause I was inspired by all of my friends
To stage a robbery, the third Saturday I clocked in
Projects tore up, gang signs get thrown up (Sup?)
Cocaine laced in marijuana
And they wonder why I rarely smoke now
Imagine if your first blunt had you foamin' at the mouth
I was straight tweakin', the next weekend we broke even
I made allegiance that made a promise to see you bleedin'
You know the reasons, but still'll never know my life

Shit, the hood took me under, so I follow the rules
But, yeah, that's like me, I grew up in the hood where they bang
And niggas that rep colors is doin' the same thang
Pass it to the left, so I can smoke on me
A couple drive-bys in the hood lately, yeah
Couple of IV's with the fuckin' spray-can
Shots in the crowd, then everybody ran
Crew I'm finna slay, the street life I crave
Shots hit the enemy, hearts turn brave
Mount up, regulators in the whip
Down the boulevard with the pistol grip, yeah
Trip, we in the hood still
So, loc, grab a strap 'cause, yeah, it's so real, yeah
Deal with the outcome, a strap in the hand
And a bird and ten grand's where a mothafucka stand

If I told you I killed a nigga at sixteen, would you believe me?
Perceive me to be innocent Kendrick you seen in the street
With a basketballand some Now and Laters to eat?
If I mentioned all of my skeletons, would you jump in the seat?
Would you say my intelligence now is great relief?
And it's safe to say that our next generation maybe can sleep
With dreams of bein' a lawyer or doctor
Instead of boy with a chopper that hold the cul-de-sac hostage
Kill 'em all if they gossip
The Children of the Corn,they vandalizin' the option
Of livin' a lie, drown their body with toxins
Constantly drinkin' and drive
Hit the powder, then watch this flame that arrive in his eye
Listen, coward, the concept is aim and then bang it and slide
Out that bitch with deposit, a price on his head, the tithes
Probably go to the projects

Now, who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?
They said I rap like a robot, so call me Rap-bot
[Verse 1]
But for me to rap like a computer it must be in my genes
I got a laptop in my back pocket
My pen'll go off when I half-cock it
Got a fat knot from that rap profit
Made a livin' and a killin' off it
Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office
With Monica Lewinsky feelin' on his nutsack
I'm an MC still as honest
But as rude and as indecent as all hell
Syllables, skill-a-holic (Kill 'em all with)
This flippity dippity-hippity hip-hop
You don't really wanna get into a pissin' match
With this rappity brat, packin' a MAC in the back of the Ac'
Backpack rap crap, yap-yap, yackety-yack
And at the exact same time, I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while I'm practicin' that
I'll still be able to break a motherfuckin' table
Over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half
Only realized it was ironic, I was signed to Aftermath after the fact
How could I not blow? All I do is drop F-bombs
Feel my wrath of attack
Rappers are havin' a rough time period, here's a maxi pad
It's actually disastrously bad for the wack
While I'm masterfully constructing this masterpièce

[Verse 2]
Well, to be truthful the blueprint's
Simply rage and youthful exuberance
Everybody loves to root for a nuisance
Hit the Earth like an asteroid
Did nothing but shoot for the Moon since (Pew!)
MCs get taken to school with this music
'Cause I use it as a vehicle to ""bus the rhyme""
Now I lead a new school full of students
Me? I'm a product of Rakim
Lakim Shabazz, 2Pac, N.W.A, Cube, hey Doc, Ren
Yella, Eazy, thank you, they got Slim
Inspired enough to one day grow up, blow up and be in a position
To meet Run–D.M.C., and induct them
Into the motherfuckin' Rock and Roll Hall of Fame
Even though I'll walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames
Only Hall of Fame I'll be inducted in is the alcohol of fame
On the wall of shame
You fags think it's all a game, 'til I walk a flock of flames
Off a plank and, tell me what in the fuck are you thinkin'?
Little gay-lookin' boy
So gay I can barely say it with a straight face, lookin' boy (Ha-ha!)
You're witnessin' a mass-occur
Like you're watching a church gathering take place, lookin' boy
""Oy vey, that boy's gay!""—that's all they say, lookin' boy
You get a thumbs up, pat on the back
And a ""way to go"" from your label every day, lookin' boy
Hey, lookin' boy! What you say, lookin' boy?
I get a ""hell yeah"" from Dre, lookin' boy
I'ma work for everything I have, never asked nobody for shit
Get outta my face, lookin' boy!
Basically, boy, you're never gonna be capable
Of keepin' up with the same pace, lookin' boy, 'cause—

Dale Earnhardt of the trailer park, the White Trash God
Kneel before General Zod
This planet's Krypton—no, Asgard, Asgard

[Verse 3]
So you'll be Thor and I'll be Odin
You rodent, I'm omnipotent
Let off, then I'm reloadin'
Immediately with these bombs I'm totin'
And I should not be woken
I'm the walkin' dead, but I'm just a talkin' head, a zombie floatin'
But I got your mom deep-throatin'
I'm out my Ramen Noodle
We have nothin' in common, poodle
I'm a Doberman, pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage, pupil
It's me, my honesty's brutal
But it's honestly futile if I don't utilize what I do though
For good at least once in a while
So I wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle enough rhymes
To maybe try to help get some people through tough times
But I gotta keep a few punchlines
Just in case 'cause even you unsigned
Rappers are hungry lookin' at me like it's lunchtime
I know there was a time where once I
Was king of the underground
But I still rap like I'm on my Pharoahe Monch grind
So I crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine
Appeal with the skin color of mine
You get too big and here they come tryin'
To censor you like that one line
I said on ""I'm Back"" from The Mathers LP 1 when I
Tried to say I'll take seven kids from Columbine
Put 'em all in a line, add an AK-47, a revolver and a 9
See if I get away with it now that I ain't as big as I was, but I'm
Morphin' into an immortal, comin' through the portal
You're stuck in a time warp from 2004 though
And I don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for
You're pointless as Rapunzel with fuckin' cornrows
You write normal? Fuck being normal!
And I just bought a new raygun from the future
Just to come and shoot ya, like when Fabolous made Ray J mad
'Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Mayweather's pad
Singin' to a man while he played piano
Man, oh man, that was a 24/7 special on the cable channel
So Ray J went straight to the radio station
The very next day, ""Hey Fab, I'ma kill you!""
Lyrics comin' at you at supersonic speed (J.J. Fad)
Uh, summa-lumma, dooma-lumma, you assumin' I'm a human
What I gotta do to get it through to you? I'm superhuman
Innovative and I'm made of rubber so that anything you say is ricochetin' off of me and it'll glue to you and
I'm devastating, more than ever demonstrating
How to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating
Never fading, and I know the haters are forever waiting
For the day that they can say I fell off, they'll be celebrating
'Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated
I make elevating music, you make elevator music
""Oh, he's too mainstream.""
Well, that's what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it
""It's not hip-hop, it's pop,""—'cause I found a hella way to fuse it
With rock, shock rap with Doc
Throw on ""Lose Yourself"" and make 'em lose it
""I don't know how to make songs like that
I don't know what words to use.""
Let me know when it occurs to you
While I'm rippin' any one of these verses that versus you
It's curtains, I'm inadvertently hurtin' you
How many verses I gotta murder to
Prove that if you were half as nice, your songs you could sacrifice virgins too?!
Ugh, school flunky, pill junkie
But look at the accolades these skills brung me
Full of myself, but still hungry
I bully myself 'cause I make me do what I put my mind to
And I'm a million leagues above you
Ill when I speak in tongues, but it's still tongue-in-cheek, fuck you
I'm drunk, so, Satan, take the fucking wheel
I'ma sleep in the front seat
Bumpin' Heavy D and the Boyz, still ""Chunky but Funky""
But in my head there's something I can feel tugging and struggling
Angels fight with devils and here's what they want from me
They're askin' me to eliminate some of the women hate
But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred
I have, then you may be a little patient
And more sympathetic to the situation
And understand the discrimination
But fuck it, life's handin' you lemons? Make lemonade then!
But if I can't batter the women
How the fuck am I supposed to bake 'em a cake then?
Don't mistake him for Satan
It's a fatal mistake if you think I need to be overseas and take a vacation
To trip a broad, and make her fall on her face and
Don't be a retard—be a king? Think not
Why be a king when you can be a god?6.8KEmbed"," the front to the back nod, back nod

Relaxing,Our Remains,"[Verse 1]
I survived the wasteland of tasting tongues but can't deny
A beacon shined in blistered light for a while
Burning in an open eye
No room for improvement
You're just some muse I use for joy
The version of you I love is some other
Not this virgin little boy
Little souls, blood in bowls and poured on anyone
It'll never be the same
Thundering loud, I stand up proud as lightning crashed the waves
I don't want to stay, I'm wearing your remains

[Verse 2]
I pulled you in my body
The thought is really odd I know
Does it alarm you or disarm you?
I should have warned you, I didn't mean to harm you so
I only said I wanted
To bring you near, you flaunted how
You were a loner and a stone
Who didn't know if you could be my home right now
Little signs are beacons shining out on anyone
It'll never be the same
Summer storm, bodies worn with shimmering lakes

On your horizon, always shining, the beacon brightest
I take my hands off all controls
Little souls can take no more, I'm torn from everyone

Cast your wreckless dreams upon our Mayflower

""But I'm only going to get this one chance"" (Six minutes—, six minutes—)
""Something's wrong, I can feel it"" (Six minutes, Slim Shady, you're on!)
""Just a feeling I've got, like something's about to happen, but I don't know what. 
If that means what I think it means, we're in trouble, big trouble; 
And if he is as bananas as you say, I'm not taking any chances""

I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Now, who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?
They said I rap like a robot, so call me Rap-bot
[Verse 1]
But for me to rap like a computer it must be in my genes
I got a laptop in my back pocket
My pen'll go off when I half-cock it
Got a fat knot from that rap profit
Made a livin' and a killin' off it
Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office
With Monica Lewinsky feelin' on his nutsack
I'm an MC still as honest
But as rude and as indecent as all hell
Syllables, skill-a-holic (Kill 'em all with)
This flippity dippity-hippity hip-hop
You don't really wanna get into a pissin' match
With this rappity brat, packin' a MAC in the back of the Ac'
Backpack rap crap, yap-yap, yackety-yack
And at the exact same time, I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while I'm practicin' that
I'll still be able to break a motherfuckin' table
Over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half
Only realized it was ironic, I was signed to Aftermath after the fact
How could I not blow? All I do is drop F-bombs
Feel my wrath of attack

Well, to be truthful the blueprint's
Simply rage and youthful exuberance
Everybody loves to root for a nuisance
Hit the Earth like an asteroid
Did nothing but shoot for the Moon since (Pew!)
MCs get taken to school with this music
'Cause I use it as a vehicle to ""bus the rhyme""
Now I lead a new school full of students
Me? I'm a product of Rakim
Lakim Shabazz, 2Pac, N.W.A, Cube, hey Doc, Ren
Yella, Eazy, thank you, they got Slim
Inspired enough to one day grow up, blow up and be in a position
To meet Run–D.M.C., and induct them
Into the motherfuckin' Rock and Roll Hall of Fame
Even though I'll walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames
Only Hall of Fame I'll be inducted in is the alcohol of fame
On the wall of shame

Off a plank and, tell me what in the fuck are you thinkin'?

So you'll be Thor and I'll be Odin
You rodent, I'm omnipotent
Let off, then I'm reloadin'
Immediately with these bombs I'm totin'
And I should not be woken
I'm the walkin' dead, but I'm just a talkin' head, a zombie floatin'
But I got your mom deep-throatin'
I'm out my Ramen Noodle
We have nothin' in common, poodle
I'm a Doberman, pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage, pupil
It's me, my honesty's brutal
But it's honestly futile if I don't utilize what I do though
For good at least once in a while
So I wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle enough rhymes
To maybe try to help get some people through tough times
But I gotta keep a few punchlines
Just in case 'cause even you unsigned
Rappers are hungry lookin' at me like it's lunchtime
I know there was a time where once I
Was king of the underground
But I still rap like I'm on my Pharoahe Monch grind
So I crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine
Appeal with the skin color of mine
You get too big and here they come tryin'
To censor you like that one line
I said on ""I'm Back"" from The Mathers LP 1 when I
Tried to say I'll take seven kids from Columbine
Put 'em all in a line, add an AK-47, a revolver and a 9
See if I get away with it now that I ain't as big as I was, but I'm
Morphin' into an immortal, comin' through the portal
You're stuck in a time warp from 2004 though
And I don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for
You're pointless as Rapunzel with fuckin' cornrows
You write normal? Fuck being normal!
And I just bought a new raygun from the future
Just to come and shoot ya, like when Fabolous made Ray J mad
'Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Mayweather's pad
Singin' to a man while he played piano
Man, oh man, that was a 24/7 special on the cable channel
So Ray J went straight to the radio station
The very next day, ""Hey Fab, I'ma kill you!""
Lyrics comin' at you at supersonic speed (J.J. Fad)
Uh, summa-lumma, dooma-lumma, you assumin' I'm a human
What I gotta do to get it through to you? I'm superhuman
Innovative and I'm made of rubber so that anything you say is ricochetin' off of me and it'll glue to you and
I'm devastating, more than ever demonstrating
How to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating
Never fading, and I know the haters are forever waiting
For the day that they can say I fell off, they'll be celebrating
'Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated
I make elevating music, you make elevator music
""Oh, he's too mainstream.""
Well, that's what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it
""It's not hip-hop, it's pop,""—'cause I found a hella way to fuse it
With rock, shock rap with Doc
Throw on ""Lose Yourself"" and make 'em lose it
""I don't know how to make songs like that
I don't know what words to use.""
Let me know when it occurs to you
While I'm rippin' any one of these verses that versus you
It's curtains, I'm inadvertently hurtin' you
How many verses I gotta murder to
Prove that if you were half as nice, your songs you could sacrifice virgins too?!
Ugh, school flunky, pill junkie
But look at the accolades these skills brung me
Full of myself, but still hungry
I bully myself 'cause I make me do what I put my mind to
And I'm a million leagues above you
Ill when I speak in tongues, but it's still tongue-in-cheek, fuck you
I'm drunk, so, Satan, take the fucking wheel
I'ma sleep in the front seat
Bumpin' Heavy D and the Boyz, still ""Chunky but Funky""
But in my head there's something I can feel tugging and struggling
Angels fight with devils and here's what they want from me
They're askin' me to eliminate some of the women hate
But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred
I have, then you may be a little patient
And more sympathetic to the situation
And understand the discrimination
But fuck it, life's handin' you lemons? Make lemonade then!
But if I can't batter the women
How the fuck am I supposed to bake 'em a cake then?
Don't mistake him for Satan
It's a fatal mistake if you think I need to be overseas and take a vacation
To trip a broad, and make her fall on her face and

Dear Adonis
I'm sorry that that man is your father, let me be honest
It takes a man to be a man, your dad is not responsive
I look at him and wish your grandpa woulda wore a condom
I'm sorry that you gotta grow up and then stand behind him
Life is hard, I know, the challenge is always gon' beat us home
Sometimes our parents make mistakes that affect us until we grown
And you're a good kid that need good leadership
Let me be your mentor since your daddy don't teach you shit
Never let a man piss on your leg, son
Either you die right there or pop that man in the head, son
Never fall in the escort business, that's bad religion
Please remember, you could be a bitch even if you got bitches
Never code-switch, whether right or wrong, you're a Black man
Even if it don't benefit your goals, do some push-ups, get some discipline
Don't cut them corners like your daddy did, fuck what Ozempic did
Don't pay to play with them Brazilians, get a gym membership
Understand, no throwin' rocks and hidin' hands, that's law
Don't be ashamed 'bout who you wit', that's how he treat your moms
Don't have a kid to hide a kid to hide again, be sure
Five percent will comprehend, but ninety-five is lost
Be proud of who you are, your strength come from within
Lotta superstars that's real, but your daddy ain't one of them
And you nothing like him, you'll carry yourself as king
Can't understand me right now? Just play this when you eighteen

Dear Dennis, you gave birth to a master manipulator
Even usin' you to prove who he is is a huge favor
I think you should ask for more paper, and more paper
And more, uh, more paper
I'm blamin' you for all his gamblin' addictions
Psychopath intuition, the man that like to play victim
You raised a horrible fuckin' person, the nerve of you, Dennis
Sandra, sit down, what I'm about to say is heavy, now listen
Mm-mm, your son's a sick man with sick thoughts, I think niggas like him should die
Him and Weinstein should get fucked up in a cell for the rest their life
He hates Black women, hypersexualizes 'em with kinks of a nympho fetish
Grew facial hair because he understood bein' a beard just fit him better
He got sex offenders on ho-VO that he keep on a monthly allowance
A child should never be compromised and he keepin' his child around them
And we gotta raise our daughters knowin' there's predators like him lurkin'
Fuck a rap battle, he should die so all of these women can live with a purpose
I been in this industry twelve years, I'ma tell y'all one lil' secret
It's some weird shit goin' on and some of these artists be here to police it
They be streamlinin' victims all inside of they home and callin' 'em tender
Then leak videos of themselves to further push their agendas
To any woman that be playin' his music, know that you're playin' your sister
Or better, you're sellin' your niece to the weirdos, not the good ones
Katt Williams said, ""Get you the truth,"" so I'ma get mines
The Embassy 'bout to get raided too, it's only a matter of time
Ayy, LeBron, keep the family away, hey, Curry, keep the family away
To anybody that embody the love for their kids, keep the family away
They lookin' at you too if you standin' by him, keep the family away
I'm lookin' to shoot through any pervert that lives, keep the family safe

Dear baby girl
I'm sorry that your father not active inside your world
He don't commit to much but his music, yeah, that's for sure
He a narcissist, misogynist, livin' inside his songs
Try destroyin' families rather than takin' care of his own
Should be teachin' you time tables or watchin' Frozen with you
Or at your eleventh birthday singin' poems with you
Instead, he be in Turks payin' for sex and poppin' Percs, examples that you don't deserve
I wanna tell you that you're loved, you're brave, you're kind
You got a gift to change the world, and could change your father's mind
'Cause our children is the future, but he lives inside confusion
Money's always been illusion, but that's the life he's used to
His father prolly didn't claim him neither
History do repeats itself, sometimes it don't need a reason
But I would like to say it's not your fault that he's hidin' another child
Give him grace, this the reason I made Mr. Morale
So our babies like you can cope later
Give you some confidence to go through somethin', it's hope later
I never wanna hear you chase a man 'cause it's feral behavior
Sittin' in the club with sugar daddies for validation
You need to know that love is eternity and trumps all pain
I'll tell you who your father is, just play this song when it rains
Yes, he's a hitmaker, songwriter, superstar, right
And a fuckin' deadbeat that should never say ""more life""

Dear Aubrey
I know you probably thinkin' I wanted to crash your party
But truthfully, I don't have a hatin' bone in my body
This supposed to be a good exhibition within the game
But you fucked up the moment you called out my family's name
Why you had to stoop so low to discredit some decent people?
Guess integrity is lost when the metaphors doesn't reach you
And I like to understand 'cause your house was never a home
Thirty-seven, but you showin' up as a seven-year-old
You got gamblin' problems, drinkin' problems, pill-poppin' and spendin' problems
Bad with money, whorehouse
Solicitin' women problems, therapy's a lovely start
But I suggest some ayahuasca, strip the ego from the bottom
I try to empathize with you 'cause I know that you ain't been through nothin'
Crave entitlement, but wanna be liked so bad that it's puzzlin'
No dominance, let's recap moments when you didn't fit in
No secret handshakes with your friend
No culture cachet to binge, just disrespectin' your mother
Identity's on the fence, don't know which family will love ya

Can't channel your masculine even when standin' next to a woman

Relaxing,Song Song,"Music box playing a song by Aus Rotten
When I closed the lid 5 minutes ago
Try to drown it out with the budget girls
While my breath paints a broken dream on the window
You act like none of this shit even matters
And that's all very well but I'm still stuck here
Drowning in a pool of unsent letters
Reasons why I'm glad that you can't be here

So write another acoustic song about a war you've never seen
The new girl you're now in love with
Now you've fallen out of love with me
And are you still ripping off all thе records I lent you?
Still on fire from thе maths inside your head?
Cos I'm finding it hard to feel anything
About the things we did and the things you said

Said you hadn't drunk but your eyes were rolling
Tried to pretend that it didn't hurt
Just count to ten and breathe a bit deeper
Remembering that it could all be so much worse
Hanging around waiting for a phone call
When I didn't even want to hear your voice
Hard when it smacks you right in the face
That you might have made the wrong choice

And smashing the pride
The morning's got you on the ropes, oh
And love is a murderer, love is a murderer
But if she calls you tonight
Everything is all right
